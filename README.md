Project work is contained in the Flat.lean file here in the topmost directory.  
Main result is constructing Hom and Tensor functors and proving adjointness, along with some results and definitions on flatness and faithful flatness.  
Still need to finish FaithfulFlatness TFAE statement regarding statements of it reflecting exactness, tensoring nontrivial in general/with residue fields/maximal quotients.  
Still need to finish both the Flat and Faithful Flat morphisms extending flat/faithfulflatness. Here I attempted to use almost only the Class definition of Flat/faithful (so ignoring the TFAE statements or at least what we have of them).  
Still need to flesh out api involving both the category theory and flat/faithfully flat side of things
