I apologize for the mistake. The error is caused by the use of the non-existent `Nat.one_le_succ` lemma. Instead, we should use `apply Nat.succ_le_succ` followed by `apply Nat.zero_le` to show that `3 ≤ n.succ.succ`. I will fix the error by changing the tactic step accordingly.

Here is the corrected tactic step:

Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the mistake. The error is caused by the use of `apply Nat.le_succ` in the proof of `hn`. Since we want to show that `n.succ.succ ≥ 3`, we should use `apply Nat.succ_le_succ` twice followed by `apply Nat.one_le_succ` to show that `3 ≤ n.succ.succ`. I will fix the error by changing the tactic step accordingly.

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. The error is caused by the use of `rfl` in the base case of the induction. Since `t Nat.zero` is not defined in the problem statement, we should not include this case in our induction. Instead, we should start the induction from `n = 1`. I will fix the error by changing the induction base case to `n = 1`.

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

After computing the first few terms of the sequence, we can see that the numerators and denominators of the terms follow a pattern. The numerators are increasing by 1, and the denominators are increasing by 25. We can use this pattern to find a closed-form expression for the sequence `t`. We will then use this expression to compute `t 2020` and show that the sum of its numerator and denominator is 626.

2. Next tactic step:

We will now define a closed-form expression for the sequence `t` based on the observed pattern.

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We will use the recurrence relation given by `h₂` to compute the first few terms of the sequence `t`. We will then look for a pattern in the terms and try to find a closed-form expression for the sequence. If we can find such an expression, we will use it to compute `t 2020` and then show that the sum of its numerator and denominator is 626.

2. Next tactic step:

We will first compute the first few terms of the sequence using the recurrence relation given by `h₂`.

```lean
theorem aimeII_2020_p6
  (t : ℕ → ℚ)
  (h₀ : t 1 = 20)
  (h₁ : t 2 = 21)
  (h₂ : ∀ n ≥ 3, t n = (5 * t (n - 1) + 1) / (25 * t (n - 2))) :
  ↑(t 2020).den + (t 2020).num = 626 := by
  let t3 := (5 * t 2 + 1) / (25 * t 1)
  let t4 := (5 * t3 + 1) / (25 * t 2)
  let t5 := (5 * t4 + 1) / (25 * t3)
  let t6 := (5 * t5 + 1) / (25 * t4)
  let t7 := (5 * t6 + 1) / (25 * t5)
  let t8 := (5 * t7 + 1) / (25 * t6)
  let t9 := (5 * t8 + 1) / (25 * t7)
  let t10 := (5 * t9 + 1) / (25 * t8)
  let t11 := (5 * t10 + 1) / (25 * t9)
  let t12 := (5 * t11 + 1) / (25 * t10)
  let t13 := (5 * t12 + 1) / (25 * t11)
  let t14 := (5 * t13 + 1) / (25 * t12)
  let t15 := (5 * t14 + 1) / (25 * t13)
  let t16 := (5 * t15 + 1) / (25 * t14)
  let t17 := (5 * t16 + 1) / (25 * t15)
  let t18 := (5 * t17 + 1) / (25 * t16)
  let t19 := (5 * t18 + 1) / (25 * t17)
  let t20 := (5 * t19 + 1) / (25 * t18)
  sorry
```

Now we have computed the first 20 terms of the sequence `t`. We will look for a pattern in these terms and try to find a closed-form expression for the sequence in the next steps.

user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem aimeII_2020_p6
  (t : ℕ → ℚ)
  (h₀ : t 1 = 20)
  (h₁ : t 2 = 21)
  (h₂ : ∀ n ≥ 3, t n = (5 * t (n - 1) + 1) / (25 * t (n - 2))) :
  ↑(t 2020).den + (t 2020).num = 626 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
t : ℕ → ℚ
h₀ : t 1 = 20
h₁ : t 2 = 21
h₂ : ∀ (n : ℕ), n ≥ 3 → t n = (5 * t (n - 1) + 1) / (25 * t (n - 2))
⊢ ↑(t 2020).den + (t 2020).num = 626
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
