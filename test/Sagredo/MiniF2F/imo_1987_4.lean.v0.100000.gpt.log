I apologize for the confusion. It seems that I made a mistake in using `linarith` to find the contradiction. Instead, we can use the `contradiction` tactic after observing that `f n = n + 1988` contradicts the fact that `n < 1988`.

Here's the corrected proof with the appropriate tactic:

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Finset

theorem imo_1987_p4
  (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  ∃ n, f (f n) ≠ n + 1987 := by
  have h_pigeonhole : ∃ a b, a ≠ b ∧ f a = f b := by
    let s := Finset.range 1988
    let t := Finset.image f s
    have h_size : Finset.card s > Finset.card t := by

I apologize for the confusion. The error is due to the fact that I used the `rw` tactic to rewrite the goal using `h_eq`, but the pattern does not appear in the target expression. Instead, we can directly use `h_eq` in the `linarith` tactic to find the contradiction.

Here's the corrected proof with the appropriate tactic:

I apologize for the oversight. In Lean 4, when using the `rw` tactic, we need to enclose the lemma or equation in square brackets, even if there is just one. I will correct the tactic step by adding square brackets around `h_eq`.

1. To show that the cardinality of s is greater than the cardinality of t, we can use the fact that s is the set of the first 1988 natural numbers, so its cardinality is 1988. Since t is the image of s under the function f, its cardinality is at most 1988. However, we need to show that the cardinality of t is strictly less than 1988. We can do this by showing that there exists at least one natural number that is not in the image of s under f. For example, we can show that the number 1988 is not in the image of s under f, since f(n) cannot be equal to n + 1988 for any n in s.

2. Let's add the next tactic step to show that the cardinality of s is greater than the cardinality of t.

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. The error is due to the fact that the type of the result provided by `Finset.exists_ne_map_eq_of_card_lt_of_maps_to` is slightly different from the type we want for `h_pigeonhole`. The lemma provides a result of the form `∃ x, x ∈ s ∧ ∃ y, y ∈ s ∧ x ≠ y ∧ f x = f y`, while we want a result of the form `∃ a b, a ≠ b ∧ f a = f b`. We can fix this by using the `obtain` tactic to extract the relevant values of a and b from the result provided by the lemma.

Here's the corrected proof with the appropriate lemma and the `obtain` tactic:

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Finset

theorem imo_1987_p4

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that I made a mistake in referencing the `finset.pigeonhole` lemma, which does not exist in Mathlib. Instead, we can use the `finset.exists_ne_map_eq_of_card_lt_of_maps_to` lemma, which is a more general version of the Pigeonhole Principle for finite sets. This lemma states that if the size of a finite set s is greater than the size of a finite set t, and there is a function from s to t, then there must be two distinct elements in s that are mapped to the same element in t.

Here's the corrected proof with the appropriate lemma:

assistant:
1. To prove the existence of a and b such that a ≠ b and f(a) = f(b), we can use the Pigeonhole Principle on the first 1988 values of the function f. We have 1988 possible input values {0, 1, 2, ..., 1987} and at least 1988 possible output values {f(0), f(1), f(2), ..., f(1987)}. Since there are only 1988 possible output values, there must be at least two distinct input values a and b such that f(a) = f(b).

2. We can use the `finset.pigeonhole` lemma from Mathlib to apply the Pigeonhole Principle. This lemma states that if the size of a finite set s is greater than the size of a finite set t, and there is a function from s to t, then there must be two distinct elements in s that are mapped to the same element in t.

assistant:
1. To prove this theorem, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle. Let's consider the first 1988 natural numbers, i.e., the set {0, 1, 2, ..., 1987}. Since there are 1988 numbers in this set, and f is a function from ℕ to ℕ, there must be at least one number in this set that is mapped to the same value by f. In other words, there exist two distinct natural numbers a and b such that f(a) = f(b). We can then consider the values of f(f(a)) and f(f(b)). If f(f(a)) ≠ a + 1987 and f(f(b)) ≠ b + 1987, we are done. If either f(f(a)) = a + 1987 or f(f(b)) = b + 1987, we can use the fact that f(a) = f(b) to show that the other value must be different from the corresponding number plus 1987.

2. Let's start by applying the Pigeonhole Principle to the first 1988 natural numbers. We can do this by using the `have` tactic to introduce a new fact.

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Finset

theorem imo_1987_p4
  (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  ∃ n, f (f n) ≠ n + 1987 := by

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
