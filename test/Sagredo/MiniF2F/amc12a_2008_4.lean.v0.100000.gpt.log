assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. I should have used the `by` keyword before the `normNum` tactic. Here is the corrected helper lemma:

```lean
import data.finset.basic
import data.real.basic

lemma helper (k : ℕ) : ((4 : ℝ) * k + 4) / (4 * k) = (4 * (k + 1)) / (4 * k) := by
  rw [add_mul, one_mul, Nat.cast_add, Nat.cast_one, Nat.cast_mul, Nat.cast_four, mul_div_mul_left _ _ (by show (4 : ℝ) ≠ 0, by normNum)]

theorem amc12a_2008_p4 :
  ∏ k in Finset.Icc (1 : ℕ) 501, ((4 : ℝ) * k + 4) / (4 * k) = 502 := by
  apply finset.prod_congr (Finset.Icc_refl 1 501) helper
```

Now we have a new goal to prove, which is the equality of the two sides of the equation.

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 2, located on the tokens `normNum)]`:

```
error: unknown tactic
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
You used normNum)], but it looks like you maybe meant . Try that instead.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the confusion. I made an error in my previous response. There is no `Finset.prod_Icc_eq_factorial` lemma in Lean. Instead, let's use the `finset.prod_congr` lemma to rewrite the product. We will first prove a helper lemma that shows the equality of the two functions in the product:

```lean
import data.finset.basic
import data.real.basic

lemma helper (k : ℕ) : ((4 : ℝ) * k + 4) / (4 * k) = (4 * (k + 1)) / (4 * k) := by
  rw [add_mul, one_mul, Nat.cast_add, Nat.cast_one, Nat.cast_mul, Nat.cast_four, mul_div_mul_left _ _ (show (4 : ℝ) ≠ 0, by normNum)]

theorem amc12a_2008_p4 :
  ∏ k in Finset.Icc (1 : ℕ) 501, ((4 : ℝ) * k + 4) / (4 * k) = 502 := by
  apply finset.prod_congr (Finset.Icc_refl 1 501) helper
```

Now we have a new goal to prove, which is the equality of the two sides of the equation.

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. In Lean, we cannot use `...` as a placeholder for the remaining terms in the product. Instead, we can proceed with the proof without explicitly writing out the product. Let's remove the `have` tactic and start with the `apply` tactic to apply the `Finset.prod_Icc_eq_factorial` lemma directly:

```lean
theorem amc12a_2008_p4 :
  ∏ k in Finset.Icc (1 : ℕ) 501, ((4 : ℝ) * k + 4) / (4 * k) = 502 := by
  apply Finset.prod_Icc_eq_factorial 1 501 (fun k => ((4 : ℝ) * k + 4) / (4 * k))
```

Now we have a new goal to prove, which is the equality of the two sides of the equation.

To begin the proof, let's first rewrite the product using the fact that `∏ k in Finset.Icc a b, f k = f a * f (a+1) * ... * f b` for a finite set. We can do this using the `have` tactic to introduce a new fact:

```lean
theorem amc12a_2008_p4 :
  ∏ k in Finset.Icc (1 : ℕ) 501, ((4 : ℝ) * k + 4) / (4 * k) = 502 := by
  have h : ∏ k in Finset.Icc (1 : ℕ) 501, ((4 : ℝ) * k + 4) / (4 * k) = 
           (((4 * 1 + 4) / (4 * 1)) * ((4 * 2 + 4) / (4 * 2)) * ... * ((4 * 501 + 4) / (4 * 501))) :=
    Finset.prod_Icc_eq_factorial 1 501 (fun k => ((4 : ℝ) * k + 4) / (4 * k))
  sorry
```

Now, we have a new goal to prove `h`.

user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem amc12a_2008_p4 :
  ∏ k in Finset.Icc (1 : ℕ) 501, ((4 : ℝ) * k + 4) / (4 * k) = 502 := by sorry
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
