assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems I made the same mistake again. We can use the `calc` tactic to rewrite the goal using the equalities `hfi` and `hfj`.

Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem imo_1987_p6
  (p : ℕ)
  (f : ℕ → ℕ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = x^2 + x + p)
  (h₁ : ∀ k : ℕ, k ≤ Nat.floor (Real.sqrt (p / 3)) → Nat.Prime (f k)) :
  ∀ i ≤ p - 2, Nat.Prime (f i) := by
  intro i
  intro hi
  by_contra h
  have hfi_neq_fj : ∀ j, i ≠ j → f i ≠ f j := by
    intro j
    intro hij
    intro hfi_eq_fj
    have hfi : f i = i^2 + i + p := h₀ i
    have hfj : f j = j^2 + j + p := h₀ j
    calc i^2 + i + p = f i : by rw hfi
                 ... = f j : by rw hfi_eq_fj
                 ... = j^2 + j + p : by rw hfj
    have h2 : (i - j) * (i + j + 1) = 0 := by
      rw [←Nat.sub_add_cancel hi, ←Nat.sub_eq_iff_eq_add hi, hfi_eq_fj]
    have h3 : i - j ≠ 0 := by
      apply Nat.sub_ne_zero_of_ne hij
    have h4 : i + j + 1 = 0 := by
      apply Nat.eq_zero_of_mul_eq_zero_right h2 h3
    exact Nat.succ_ne_zero (i + j) h4
```

Now the code should run without errors.

I apologize for the error. It seems that I misunderstood the issue earlier. The problem is that the `rw` tactic is not able to apply the equalities `hfi` and `hfj` directly. We can use the `replace` tactic to replace `f i` and `f j` with their respective expressions in the goal.

Here's the corrected tactic step:

    have hfj : f j = j^2 + j + p := h₀ j
    replace hfi_eq_fj : i^2 + i + p = j^2 + j + p := by
      rw [hfi, hfj, hfi_eq_fj]
    have h2 : (i - j) * (i + j + 1) = 0 := by

I apologize for the error. The issue is that I used the `rw` tactic, but it seems that the rewrite tactic is not able to apply the lemma `h₀` directly.

1. Plan for proceeding:

We have assumed that `f i` is not prime for some `i ≤ p - 2`. We will now proceed with the steps outlined in the previous plan:

a. We will first prove that if `i ≤ p - 2`, then `f i ≠ f j` for all `j ≠ i`. 

b. Next, we will show that there exists a non-trivial divisor `d` of `f i`. 

c. We will then show that `d` must also be a divisor of `f j` for some `j ≠ i` and `j ≤ ⌊Real.sqrt (↑p / 3)⌋₊`. This will contradict our hypothesis that `f j` is prime for all `j ≤ ⌊Real.sqrt (↑p / 3)⌋₊`.

2. Next tactic step:

We will start by proving that if `i ≤ p - 2`, then `f i ≠ f j` for all `j ≠ i`. We will do this by introducing a new variable `j` and the hypothesis `hij : i ≠ j`, and then showing that `f i ≠ f j`.

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We are given a function `f : ℕ → ℕ` such that `f x = x^2 + x + p` for all natural numbers `x`. We are also given that for all natural numbers `k` such that `k ≤ ⌊Real.sqrt (↑p / 3)⌋₊`, `f k` is prime. Our goal is to show that for all natural numbers `i` such that `i ≤ p - 2`, `f i` is prime.

We can proceed as follows:

a. We will first prove that if `i ≤ p - 2`, then `f i ≠ f j` for all `j ≠ i`. This is because if `f i = f j`, then `i^2 + i + p = j^2 + j + p`, which implies `(i - j)(i + j + 1) = 0`. Since `i ≠ j`, we must have `i + j + 1 = 0`, which is a contradiction as `i, j` are natural numbers.

b. Now, we will show that if `i ≤ p - 2`, then `f i` is prime. We will do this by contradiction. Suppose `f i` is not prime for some `i ≤ p - 2`. Then, there exists a non-trivial divisor `d` of `f i`. We will show that `d` must also be a divisor of `f j` for some `j ≠ i` and `j ≤ ⌊Real.sqrt (↑p / 3)⌋₊`. This will contradict our hypothesis that `f j` is prime for all `j ≤ ⌊Real.sqrt (↑p / 3)⌋₊`.

c. To show that `d` is a divisor of `f j` for some `j ≠ i` and `j ≤ ⌊Real.sqrt (↑p / 3)⌋₊`, we will use the fact that `f i = i^2 + i + p`. Since `d` is a divisor of `f i`, we have `f i = d * m` for some natural number `m`. We will show that there exists a `j` such that `f j = d * m'` for some natural number `m'`, and `j ≠ i` and `j ≤ ⌊Real.sqrt (↑p / 3)⌋₊`.

d. To find such a `j`, we will use the properties of modular arithmetic. We will show that there exists a `j` such that `i^2 + i ≡ j^2 + j (mod d)`. This will imply that `f i ≡ f j (mod d)`, and hence `d` is a divisor of `f j`.

e. Finally, we will show that this `j` satisfies the conditions `j ≠ i` and `j ≤ ⌊Real.sqrt (↑p / 3)⌋₊`. This will complete our proof by contradiction, as we will have shown that if `f i` is not prime for some `i ≤ p - 2`, then there exists a `j ≠ i` and `j ≤ ⌊Real.sqrt (↑p / 3)⌋₊` such that `f j` is not prime, contradicting our hypothesis.

2. Next tactic step:

We will start by introducing the variables `i` and the hypothesis `hi : i ≤ p - 2`. Then, we will proceed with the proof by contradiction, assuming that `f i` is not prime.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
