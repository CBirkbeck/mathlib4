I apologize for the mistake. It seems I made yet another error in the rewrite step. I will fix the error by using the correct rewrite rules. Here's the corrected version of the proof:

You used ac_refl, but it looks like you maybe meant rfl. Try that instead.

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems I made a mistake in referring to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. In Lean 4, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is not directly available in the standard library. We will need to prove it first before using it in our main theorem. Here's the proof of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring
import algebra.ordered_field
import data.real.basic

lemma cauchy_schwarz_inequality (a1 a2 b1 b2 : ℝ) :
  (a1 * b1 + a2 * b2)^2 ≤ (a1^2 + a2^2) * (b1^2 + b2^2) := by
  have h₁ : 0 ≤ (a1 * b2 - a2 * b1)^2 := sq_nonneg _
  rw [mul_pow, mul_pow, add_mul, mul_add, mul_add, mul_comm a2 b1, mul_comm a1 b2, sub_mul, sub_mul, mul_assoc, mul_assoc, mul_assoc, mul_assoc] at h₁
  have h₂ : (a1 * b1 + a2 * b2)^2 + (a1 * b2 - a2 * b1)^2 = (a1^2 + a2^2) * (b1^2 + b2^2) := by

    ac_refl
  rw [←h₂] at h₁
  exact le_of_add_le_add_right h₁

theorem algebra_apb4leq8ta4pb4
  (a b : ℝ)
  (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b) :

  have h₁ : (a * b + a * b)^2 ≤ (a^2 + a^2) * (b^2 + b^2) :=
    cauchy_schwarz_inequality a a b b

Apologies for the error. It seems I made a mistake in the syntax. I will fix the error by using the `from` keyword to apply the `algebra.cauchy_schwarz_inequality` directly in the `have` statement. Here's the corrected version:

1. Plan for proceeding:
We will prove the inequality by applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers a1, a2, ..., an and b1, b2, ..., bn, we have:

`(a1 * b1 + a2 * b2 + ... + an * bn)^2 ≤ (a1^2 + a2^2 + ... + an^2) * (b1^2 + b2^2 + ... + bn^2)`

In our case, we will choose a1 = a2 = a, b1 = b2 = b. Then, we will simplify the inequality and show that it implies the desired inequality.

2. Next tactic step:
We will start by applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to our chosen values of a1, a2, b1, and b2.

```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring
import algebra.ordered_field
import data.real.basic

theorem algebra_apb4leq8ta4pb4
  (a b : ℝ)
  (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b) :
  (a + b)^4 ≤ 8 * (a^4 + b^4) := by
  have h₁ : (a * b + a * b)^2 ≤ (a^2 + a^2) * (b^2 + b^2), from
    algebra.cauchy_schwarz_inequality a a b b
```
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem algebra_apb4leq8ta4pb4
  (a b : ℝ)
  (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b) :
  (a + b)^4 ≤ 8 * (a^4 + b^4) := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
a b : ℝ
h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b
⊢ (a + b) ^ 4 ≤ 8 * (a ^ 4 + b ^ 4)
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
