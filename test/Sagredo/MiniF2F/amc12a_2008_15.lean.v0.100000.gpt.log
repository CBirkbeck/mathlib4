Apologies for the mistake. The `mod_pow_mod` lemma has a mismatch in the expected type. I will fix the error by updating the lemma to match the expected type.

Here is the corrected proof with the next tactic step:

```lean
lemma mod_add_mod (a b n : ℕ) : (a + b) % n = (a % n + b % n) % n :=
  Nat.add_mod a b n

lemma mod_mul_mod (a b n : ℕ) : (a * b) % n = (a % n * (b % n)) % n :=
  Nat.mul_mod a b n

lemma mod_pow_mod (a b n : ℕ) : (a ^ b) % n = (a % n ^ b % n) % n :=
  Nat.pow_mod a b n

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 8, located on the tokens `Nat.pow_mod a b n`:

```
error: type mismatch
  Nat.pow_mod a b n
has type
  a ^ b % n = (a % n) ^ b % n : Prop
but is expected to have type
  a ^ b % n = a % n ^ b % n : Prop

Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

Apologies for the mistake. It seems that the kernel is running into a deep recursion issue. To fix this, I will break down the simplification into smaller steps and use intermediate lemmas to avoid deep recursion.

Here is the corrected proof with the next tactic step:

Apologies for the mistake. It seems that the simplification I attempted is not directly achievable using the `repeat {rw [Nat.add_mod, Nat.mul_mod, Nat.pow_mod]}` tactic. I will fix the error by breaking down the simplification into smaller steps.

1. Plan:
   - First, we will use the property that `(a + b) % n = ((a % n) + (b % n)) % n` to break down the expression `((2008 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2008) ^ 2 + 2 ^ (2008 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2008)) % 10`.
   - Then, we will use the property that `(a * b) % n = ((a % n) * (b % n)) % n` to simplify the expression further.
   - Next, we will compute the simplified expressions modulo 10.
   - Finally, we will show that the resulting expression is equal to 6.

Apologies for the mistake. In Lean 4, we need to enclose the lemma in square brackets when using the `rw` tactic. I will fix the error by adding square brackets around `h₀`.

1. Plan:
   - First, we will rewrite the goal using the given hypothesis `h₀`.
   - Then, we will simplify the expression `(2008 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2008) ^ 2 + 2 ^ (2008 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2008)` modulo 10.
   - We will use the property that `(a + b) % n = ((a % n) + (b % n)) % n` to break down the expression.
   - We will also use the property that `(a * b) % n = ((a % n) * (b % n)) % n` to simplify further.
   - Finally, we will compute the simplified expression modulo 10 and show that it is equal to 6.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
