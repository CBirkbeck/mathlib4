assistant:
I apologize for the confusion again. It seems that `Nat.mod_def` is not available in Lean 4. In this case, let's try a different approach by using the `calc` tactic to perform arithmetic step by step. Here's the updated first step:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_200 :
  139 % 11 = 7 := by
  calc 139 % 11 = 139 - 11 * (139 / 11) : rfl
```

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 3, located on the tokens `Nat.mod_def`:

```
error: unknown constant 'Nat.mod_def'
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that `normNum` is not available in Lean 4 by default. Instead, we can use the `simp` tactic with the `Nat.mod_def` lemma to simplify the expression. Here's the updated first step:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_200 :
  139 % 11 = 7 := by
  simp [Nat.mod_def]
```

You used normNum, but it looks like you maybe meant . Try that instead.

I apologize for the confusion again. It seems that the `Nat.mod_eq_of_lt` lemma is not directly applicable in this case. Let's try a different approach. We can use the `normNum` tactic, which can prove simple arithmetic goals automatically. Here's the updated first step:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_200 :
  139 % 11 = 7 := by
  normNum
```

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `Nat.mod` definition is not directly usable for rewriting in this case. Instead, we can use the `apply` tactic to apply the `Nat.mod_eq_of_lt` lemma, which states that if `a < b`, then `a % b = a`. We can provide the proof of `139 < 11 * 11` as an argument to the lemma. Here's the updated first step:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_200 :
  139 % 11 = 7 := by
  apply Nat.mod_eq_of_lt
  exact Nat.lt_trans (Nat.lt_succ_self 121) (Nat.lt_succ_self 139)
```

assistant:
To start the proof, we can use the `rw` tactic to rewrite the expression using the definition of the modulo operation. In Lean 4, the definition of modulo is given by `Nat.mod`. So, the first step is:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_200 :
  139 % 11 = 7 := by
  rw [Nat.mod]
```

user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_numbertheory_200 :
  139 % 11 = 7 := by sorry
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
