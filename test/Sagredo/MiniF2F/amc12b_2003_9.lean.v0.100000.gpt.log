1. Plan:
   - We will simplify the expression `3 * 12 - 3 * 2` and show that it equals 30.

2. Next tactic step:

  (a b : ℝ)
  (f : ℝ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = a * x + b)

  rw [h₀ 12, h₀ 2]
  rw [h₀ 6, h₀ 2] at h₁

1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.

assistant:
I apologize for the oversight. To fix the error, we need to use square brackets when using the `rw` tactic. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem amc12b_2003_p9
  (a b : ℝ)
  (f : ℝ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = a * x + b)
  (h₁ : f 6 - f 2 = 12) :
  f 12 - f 2 = 30 := by
  rw [h₀ 12, h₀ 2]
  rw [h₀ 6, h₀ 2] at h₁
  simp at h₁
  have ha : a = 3 := by linarith
  rw [ha]
  simp
```
=====
user:
When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 11, located on the tokens `ha`:

```
error: expected '['
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

assistant:
1. Plan:
   - We will substitute the value of `a` from `ha` into the expression `a * 12 + b - (a * 2 + b)`.
   - Then, we will simplify the expression and show that it equals 30.

user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:

  (a b : ℝ)
  (f : ℝ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = a * x + b)
  (h₁ : f 6 - f 2 = 12) :
  f 12 - f 2 = 30 := by sorry
```

```
a b : ℝ
f : ℝ → ℝ
h₀ : ∀ (x : ℝ), f x = a * x + b
h₁ : f 6 - f 2 = 12
⊢ f 12 - f 2 = 30

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
