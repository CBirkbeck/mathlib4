assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. The error is due to the incorrect use of the `congr_arg` tactic. To fix this error, let's use the `rw` tactic to rewrite the goal using the definition of `f`. Here's the corrected code:

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Finset
import Mathlib.Data.Int.Basic
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.Divisors

open Finset

theorem mathd_numbertheory_211 :
  Finset.card (Finset.filter (λ n => 6 ∣ (4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ))) (Finset.range 60)) = 20 := by
  have f : ℕ → ℤ := fun n => 4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ)
  have hf : ∀ n, 6 ∣ (4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ)) ↔ 6 ∣ f n := by
    intro n
    rw [f]
  sorry
```

Now, we can proceed with the proof using the `Finset.card_eq_of_bijective` lemma as mentioned earlier.

user:
When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 6, located on the tokens `apply congr_arg (fun x => 6 ∣ x)`:

```
error: tactic 'apply' failed, failed to unify
  (6 ∣ ?m.531) = (6 ∣ ?m.532)
with
  6 ∣ 4 * ↑n - 2 ↔ 6 ∣ f n
f : ℕ → ℤ
n : ℕ
⊢ 6 ∣ 4 * ↑n - 2 ↔ 6 ∣ f n
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. The error is due to incorrect syntax for the lambda function. The correct syntax is `fun x => ...` instead of `λ x, ...`. Here's the corrected code:

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Finset
import Mathlib.Data.Int.Basic
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.Divisors

open Finset

theorem mathd_numbertheory_211 :
  Finset.card (Finset.filter (λ n => 6 ∣ (4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ))) (Finset.range 60)) = 20 := by
  have f : ℕ → ℤ := fun n => 4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ)
  have hf : ∀ n, 6 ∣ (4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ)) ↔ 6 ∣ f n := by
    intro n
    apply congr_arg (fun x => 6 ∣ x)
    rfl
  sorry
```

Now, we can proceed with the proof using the `Finset.card_eq_of_bijective` lemma as mentioned earlier.

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. The error is due to the fact that the `Iff.rfl` tactic is not able to infer the equivalence between the two expressions. To fix this error, let's use the `congr_arg` tactic to show the equivalence explicitly. Here's the corrected code:

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Finset
import Mathlib.Data.Int.Basic
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.Divisors

open Finset

theorem mathd_numbertheory_211 :

  have hf : ∀ n, 6 ∣ (4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ)) ↔ 6 ∣ f n := by
    intro n
    apply congr_arg (λ x, 6 ∣ x)
    rfl
  sorry
```

assistant:
I apologize for the oversight. The error is due to the fact that `f n` is of type `ℕ`, while `4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ)` is of type `ℤ`. To fix this error, let's change the definition of `f` to return an integer instead of a natural number. Here's the corrected code:

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Finset
import Mathlib.Data.Int.Basic
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.Divisors

open Finset

theorem mathd_numbertheory_211 :
  Finset.card (Finset.filter (λ n => 6 ∣ (4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ))) (Finset.range 60)) = 20 := by
  have f : ℕ → ℤ := fun n => 4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ)
  have hf : ∀ n, 6 ∣ (4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ)) ↔ 6 ∣ f n := by
    intro n
    exact Iff.rfl
  sorry
```

assistant:
To start the proof, let's first import the necessary libraries and set up the namespace:

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Finset
import Mathlib.Data.Int.Basic
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.Divisors

open Finset

theorem mathd_numbertheory_211 :
  Finset.card (Finset.filter (λ n => 6 ∣ (4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ))) (Finset.range 60)) = 20 := by
  sorry
```

Now, let's begin the proof by using the `Finset.card_eq_of_bijective` lemma, which states that if there exists a bijective function between two finite sets, then their cardinalities are equal. We will define a function `f` that maps elements from the filtered set to another set of integers, and show that it is bijective.

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Finset
import Mathlib.Data.Int.Basic
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.Divisors

open Finset

theorem mathd_numbertheory_211 :
  Finset.card (Finset.filter (λ n => 6 ∣ (4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ))) (Finset.range 60)) = 20 := by
  have f : ℕ → ℕ := fun n => 4 * n - 2
  have hf : ∀ n, 6 ∣ (4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ)) ↔ 6 ∣ f n := by
    intro n
    exact Iff.rfl
  sorry
```

Now, we will use the `Finset.card_eq_of_bijective` lemma to show that the cardinality of the filtered set is equal to the cardinality of another set, which we will define later.
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_numbertheory_211 :
  Finset.card (Finset.filter (λ n => 6 ∣ (4 * ↑n - (2 : ℤ))) (Finset.range 60)) = 20 := by sorry
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
