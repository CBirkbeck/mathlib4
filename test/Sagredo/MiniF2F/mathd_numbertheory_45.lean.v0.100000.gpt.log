assistant:
I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. It seems I made an error in using the `Nat.lt_succ_self` lemma. We can fix this by using the correct inequality for the modulo operation. Here's the updated proof:

```lean
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.Basic

theorem mathd_numbertheory_45 :
  (Nat.gcd 6432 132) + 11 = 23 := by
  have h1 : Nat.gcd 6432 132 = Nat.gcd 132 (6432 % 132) := Nat.gcd_rec 6432 132
  have h2 : Nat.gcd 132 (6432 % 132) = Nat.gcd 132 60 := by rw [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt (Nat.lt_of_le_of_lt (Nat.zero_le 132) (Nat.lt_trans (Nat.lt_succ_self 131) (Nat.lt_succ_self 6431)))]
  have h3 : Nat.gcd 132 60 = Nat.gcd 60 (132 % 60) := Nat.gcd_rec 132 60
  have h4 : Nat.gcd 60 (132 % 60) = Nat.gcd 60 12 := by rw [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt (Nat.lt_of_le_of_lt (Nat.zero_le 60) (Nat.lt_trans (Nat.lt_succ_self 59) (Nat.lt_succ_self 131)))]
  have h5 : Nat.gcd 60 12 = 12 := Nat.gcd_eq_right (Nat.dvd_of_mod_eq_zero (Nat.mod_eq_zero_of_dvd (Nat.dvd_of_mod_eq_zero (by norm_num))))
  rw [h1, h2, h3, h4, h5]
  norm_num
```

This should compute the gcd value and update the goal state accordingly.

Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. It seems I made an error in using the `Nat.gcd_def` constant, which does not exist in Lean 4. Instead, we can use the `Nat.gcd_rec` lemma to compute the gcd step by step using the Euclidean algorithm. Here's the updated proof:

```lean
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.Basic

theorem mathd_numbertheory_45 :
  (Nat.gcd 6432 132) + 11 = 23 := by
  have h1 : Nat.gcd 6432 132 = Nat.gcd 132 (6432 % 132) := Nat.gcd_rec 6432 132
  have h2 : Nat.gcd 132 (6432 % 132) = Nat.gcd 132 60 := by rw [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt (Nat.lt_of_le_of_lt (Nat.zero_le 132) (Nat.lt_succ_self 6431))]
  have h3 : Nat.gcd 132 60 = Nat.gcd 60 (132 % 60) := Nat.gcd_rec 132 60
  have h4 : Nat.gcd 60 (132 % 60) = Nat.gcd 60 12 := by rw [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt (Nat.lt_of_le_of_lt (Nat.zero_le 60) (Nat.lt_succ_self 131))]
  have h5 : Nat.gcd 60 12 = 12 := Nat.gcd_eq_right (Nat.dvd_of_mod_eq_zero (Nat.mod_eq_zero_of_dvd (Nat.dvd_of_mod_eq_zero (by norm_num))))
  rw [h1, h2, h3, h4, h5]
  norm_num
```

This should compute the gcd value and update the goal state accordingly.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. It seems I made an error in using the `rw` tactic with `Nat.gcd`. Instead, we can use the `have` tactic to compute the gcd step by step using the Euclidean algorithm. Here's the updated proof:

1. Plan for proceeding:

We want to show that the gcd of 6432 and 132 is 12. To do this, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the gcd. The Euclidean algorithm states that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b). We can apply this algorithm iteratively until we reach a remainder of 0. Then, the gcd will be the last non-zero remainder.

Here are the steps using the Euclidean algorithm:

gcd(6432, 132) = gcd(132, 6432 % 132)
gcd(132, 60) = gcd(60, 132 % 60)
gcd(60, 12) = gcd(12, 60 % 12)
gcd(12, 0) = 12

Now we can implement this in Lean using the `rw` tactic with the `Nat.gcd` lemma.

2. Next tactic step:

```lean
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.Basic

theorem mathd_numbertheory_45 :
  (Nat.gcd 6432 132) + 11 = 23 := by
  rw [Nat.gcd, Nat.gcd, Nat.gcd]
  norm_num
```

This should update the goal state to show that the gcd of 6432 and 132 is 12.
=====
user:
The goal state is currently:
```
⊢ Nat.gcd 6432 132 = 12
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. I made an error in my previous response. The `gcd_val` tactic does not exist in Lean 4. Instead, we can use the `norm_num` tactic to compute the gcd value. Here's the updated proof:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_45 :
  (Nat.gcd 6432 132) + 11 = 23 := by
  norm_num
```

This should compute the gcd value and update the goal state accordingly.

You used gcd_val, but it looks like you maybe meant . Try that instead.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.
=====
assistant:
To start the proof, let's first compute the gcd of 6432 and 132 using the `gcd_val` tactic:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_45 :
  (Nat.gcd 6432 132) + 11 = 23 := by
  gcd_val
```

Now, the goal state should be updated with the computed gcd value.
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_numbertheory_45 :
  (Nat.gcd 6432 132) + 11 = 23 := by sorry
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
