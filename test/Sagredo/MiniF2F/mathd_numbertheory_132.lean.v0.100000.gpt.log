1. Now that we have shown that `2004 = 12 * 167`, we can use this fact to show that `2004 % 12 = 0`. We can rewrite `2004` as `12 * 167` using the `rw` tactic and the hypothesis `h`. Then, we can use the fact that the remainder of a number divided by its divisor is 0.

2. Here's the updated proof with the next tactic step:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_132 :
  2004 % 12 = 0 := by
  have h : 2004 = 12 * 167 := by
    exact Eq.refl (12 * 167)
  rw [h]
  exact Nat.mul_mod_right 12 167
```

user:
The goal state for the sorry on line 5 is:
```
h : 2004 = 12 * 167
⊢ 2004 % 12 = 0
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that using `rfl` directly is not suitable in this situation. Let's use the `have` tactic with an explicit proof that `2004 = 12 * 167`:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_132 :
  2004 % 12 = 0 := by
  have h : 2004 = 12 * 167 := by
    exact Eq.refl (12 * 167)
  sorry
```

user:
When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 3, located on the tokens `rfl`:

```
error: type mismatch
  rfl
has type
  2004 = 2004 : Prop
but is expected to have type
  2004 = 12 * 167 : Prop
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the mistake. It seems that the `calc` tactic is not suitable for this situation. Let's use the `refl` tactic instead to show that `2004 = 12 * 167`:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_132 :
  2004 % 12 = 0 := by
  have h : 2004 = 12 * 167 := rfl
  sorry
```

1. To prove that `2004 = 12 * 167`, we can simply compute the product of `12` and `167` and show that it is equal to `2004`. In Lean, we can use the `calc` tactic to perform this computation.

2. Here's the updated proof with the next tactic step:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_132 :
  2004 % 12 = 0 := by
  have h : 2004 = 12 * 167 := by
    calc
      12 * 167 = 2004 : rfl
  sorry
```

I apologize for the confusion again. It seems that `Nat.eq_of_mod_eq_mod` is also not available in Lean 4. Let's try a different approach. We can use the `have` tactic to show that `2004` can be written as a multiple of `12`:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_132 :
  2004 % 12 = 0 := by
  have h : 2004 = 12 * 167
  sorry
```

I apologize for the mistake. It seems that `Nat.mod_def` is not available in Lean 4. In that case, let's proceed with a different approach. We can use the `apply` tactic with the `Nat.eq_of_mod_eq_mod` lemma to show that if `2004 % 12` and `0 % 12` are equal modulo 12, then they are equal:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_132 :
  2004 % 12 = 0 := by
  apply Nat.eq_of_mod_eq_mod
  sorry
```

To start the proof, let's use the `rw` tactic to rewrite the expression using the definition of the modulo operation. We'll use the `Nat.mod_def` lemma:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_132 :
  2004 % 12 = 0 := by
  rw [Nat.mod_def]
  sorry
```

user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_numbertheory_132 :
  2004 % 12 = 0 := by sorry
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
