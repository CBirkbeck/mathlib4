assistant:
I apologize for the formatting error. It seems that the `from` keyword should be on the same line as the `suffices` tactic. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring

theorem algebra_binomnegdiscrineq_10alt28asqp1
  (a : ℝ) :
  10 * a ≤ 28 * a^2 + 1 := by
  have h : 0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1 := sorry
  suffices : 0 ≤ 28 * a^2 + 1 - 10 * a, from
    by rw [sub_eq_add_neg, add_assoc, mul_neg_one, neg_add] at this; exact this
  exact h
```

Please note that I've kept the import `import algebra.ordered_ring` to make the `le_of_sub_nonneg` lemma available if needed.

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 5, located on the tokens `a,`:

```

Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

assistant:
I apologize for the error. It seems that using `rw` with `le_of_sub_nonneg` is not the correct approach. Instead, we can use the `suffices` tactic to change the goal to the desired form and then apply the hypothesis `h`. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring

theorem algebra_binomnegdiscrineq_10alt28asqp1
  (a : ℝ) :

    by rw [sub_eq_add_neg, add_assoc, mul_neg_one, neg_add] at this; exact this

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that I misunderstood the goal state. We can directly use the `le_of_sub_nonneg` lemma to rewrite the goal state and then apply the hypothesis `h`. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring

theorem algebra_binomnegdiscrineq_10alt28asqp1
  (a : ℝ) :
  10 * a ≤ 28 * a^2 + 1 := by
  have h : 0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1 := sorry
  rw [←le_of_sub_nonneg, sub_eq_add_neg, add_assoc, mul_neg_one, neg_add]
  exact h

Please note that I've added the import `import algebra.ordered_ring` to make the `le_of_sub_nonneg` lemma available.

I apologize for the error. It seems that the rewrite tactic is still not able to find the pattern in the target expression. We can use the `show` tactic to change the goal to the desired form and then use the `exact` tactic to apply the hypothesis `h`. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

=====
assistant:
I apologize for the error. It seems that the `calc` tactic is not suitable for this situation since it is expecting an equality instead of an inequality. We can use the `apply` tactic along with `le_of_sub_nonneg` to show that `10 * a ≤ 28 * a^2 + 1`. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We want to show that `10 * a ≤ 28 * a^2 + 1` for all real numbers `a`. We can rewrite the inequality as `0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`. Let's consider the quadratic function `f(a) = 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1`. We will show that this function is always non-negative for all real numbers `a`. To do this, we will find the discriminant of the quadratic function and show that it is negative. The discriminant is given by the formula `D = b^2 - 4 * a * c`, where `a = 28`, `b = -10`, and `c = 1`. If the discriminant is negative, then the quadratic function has no real roots and is always non-negative.

2. Next tactic step:

First, let's rewrite the inequality in the desired form.

```lean
theorem algebra_binomnegdiscrineq_10alt28asqp1
  (a : ℝ) :
  10 * a ≤ 28 * a^2 + 1 := by
  have h : 0 ≤ 28 * a^2 - 10 * a + 1 := sorry
  rw [←sub_nonneg, sub_eq_add_neg, add_assoc, mul_neg_one, neg_add] at h
  exact h
```
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem algebra_binomnegdiscrineq_10alt28asqp1
  (a : ℝ) :
  10 * a ≤ 28 * a^2 + 1 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
a : ℝ
⊢ 10 * a ≤ 28 * a ^ 2 + 1
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
