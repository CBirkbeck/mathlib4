assistant:
I apologize for the confusion again. It seems I made yet another mistake in the inequality. Let's fix the error by using the correct inequality `Nat.lt_succ_self 168` instead of `Nat.lt_trans (Nat.lt_succ_self 167) (Nat.lt_succ_self 179)`:

```lean
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.GcdLcm

theorem mathd_numbertheory_188 :
  Nat.gcd 180 168 = 12 := by
  rw [Nat.gcd_rec]
  rw [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt (Nat.lt_of_le_of_lt (Nat.zero_le 168) (Nat.lt_succ_self 168))]
```

Now, please provide the current goal state.

user:
When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 4, located on the tokens `(Nat.lt_succ_self 167)`:

```
error: application type mismatch
  Nat.lt_trans (Nat.lt_succ_self 167)
argument
  Nat.lt_succ_self 167
has type
  167 < Nat.succ 167 : Prop
but is expected to have type
  168 < ?m.84 : Prop
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We will use the properties of the modulo operation and the Euclidean algorithm to simplify the goal. We know that `168 % 180 = 168` because 168 is less than 180. Then, we can apply the Euclidean algorithm again to compute the gcd of 168 and 180. We have `180 % 168 = 12`, so the next step is to compute the gcd of 168 and 12. Since 12 is a divisor of 168, the gcd of 168 and 12 is 12. Thus, we will show that `Nat.gcd 168 180 = 12`.

2. Next tactic step:

```lean
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.GcdLcm

theorem mathd_numbertheory_188 :
  Nat.gcd 180 168 = 12 := by
  rw [Nat.gcd_rec]
  rw [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt (Nat.lt_of_le_of_lt (Nat.zero_le 168) (Nat.lt_succ_self 179))]
```

Now, please provide the current goal state.
=====
user:
The goal state is currently:
```
⊢ Nat.gcd (168 % 180) 180 = 12
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that `Nat.gcd_def` is not available in Mathlib. In that case, let's use the `Nat.gcd` function directly and apply the `Nat.gcd_rec` lemma to rewrite the goal:

```lean
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.GcdLcm

theorem mathd_numbertheory_188 :
  Nat.gcd 180 168 = 12 := by
  rw [Nat.gcd_rec]
```

Now, please provide the current goal state.

=====
assistant:
To start the proof, let's use the `Nat.gcd` definition which is based on the Euclidean algorithm. We can apply the `Nat.gcd_def` lemma to rewrite the goal:

```lean
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.GcdLcm

theorem mathd_numbertheory_188 :
  Nat.gcd 180 168 = 12 := by
  rw [Nat.gcd_def]
```

Now, please provide the current goal state.
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_numbertheory_188 :
  Nat.gcd 180 168 = 12 := by sorry
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
