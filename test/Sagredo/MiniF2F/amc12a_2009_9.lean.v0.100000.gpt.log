assistant:
I apologize for the confusion again. I made a mistake in the rewrite tactic. We should first rewrite `h₀'` using the fact that `0 + 3 = 3` and then rewrite the resulting expression using `h₁'`. Since `add_zero` is not working as expected, we will use a custom lemma to rewrite `h₀'`. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem amc12a_2009_p9
  (a b c : ℝ)
  (f : ℝ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x, f (x + 3) = 3 * x^2 + 7 * x + 4)
  (h₁ : ∀ x, f x = a * x^2 + b * x + c) :
  a + b + c = 2 := by
  have h₀' := h₀ 0
  have h₁' := h₁ 3
  have add_zero_lemma : 0 + 3 = 3 := rfl
  rw [add_zero_lemma] at h₀'
  rw [h₁'] at h₀'
```

user:
When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 9, located on the tokens `add_zero`:

```
error: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression
  ?a + 0

f : ℝ → ℝ
h₀ : ∀ (x : ℝ), f (x + 3) = 3 * x ^ 2 + 7 * x + 4
h₁ : ∀ (x : ℝ), f x = a * x ^ 2 + b * x + c
h₀' : f (0 + 3) = 3 * 0 ^ 2 + 7 * 0 + 4
h₁' : f 3 = a * 3 ^ 2 + b * 3 + c
⊢ a + b + c = 2
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

1. Plan:
   - We have specialized `h₀` for `x = 0` and `h₁` for `x = 3`. Now, we will equate the two expressions obtained from `h₀'` and `h₁'` using the fact that both expressions are equal to `f 3`.
   - We will then simplify the equation.
   - Finally, we will solve the simplified equation for `a + b + c`.

2. Next tactic step:
```lean
theorem amc12a_2009_p9
  (a b c : ℝ)
  (f : ℝ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x, f (x + 3) = 3 * x^2 + 7 * x + 4)
  (h₁ : ∀ x, f x = a * x^2 + b * x + c) :
  a + b + c = 2 := by
  have h₀' := h₀ 0
  have h₁' := h₁ 3
  rw [h₀'] at h₁'

1. Plan:
   - We have already specialized `h₀` for `x = 0`. Now, we will use the fact that `h₁` holds for all `x` to specialize it to the same value of `x`, i.e., `x = 0 + 3 = 3`.
   - We will then equate the two expressions obtained from `h₀'` and `h₁` and simplify the equation.

I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:

  a + b + c = 2 := by sorry

⊢ a + b + c = 2

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
