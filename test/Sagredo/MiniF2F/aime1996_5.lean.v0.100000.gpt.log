assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. I made another mistake in the `rw` tactic. We should first expand the cubic terms in `h₅'`, `h₆'`, and `h₇'` before subtracting the corresponding equations `h₂'`, `h₃'`, and `h₄'`. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem aime_1996_p5
  (a b c r s t : ℝ)
  (f g : ℝ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = x^3 + 3 * x^2 + 4 * x - 11)
  (h₁ : ∀ x, g x = x^3 + r * x^2 + s * x + t)
  (h₂ : f a = 0)
  (h₃ : f b = 0)
  (h₄ : f c = 0)
  (h₅ : g (a + b) = 0)
  (h₆ : g (b + c) = 0)
  (h₇ : g (c + a) = 0)
  (h₈ : List.Pairwise (·≠·) [a, b, c]) :
  t = 23 := by
    have h₂' : a^3 + 3 * a^2 + 4 * a - 11 = 0 := by rw [←h₀, h₂]
    have h₃' : b^3 + 3 * b^2 + 4 * b - 11 = 0 := by rw [←h₀, h₃]
    have h₄' : c^3 + 3 * c^2 + 4 * c - 11 = 0 := by rw [←h₀, h₄]
    have h₅' : (a + b)^3 + r * (a + b)^2 + s * (a + b) + t = 0 := by rw [←h₁, h₅]
    have h₆' : (b + c)^3 + r * (b + c)^2 + s * (b + c) + t = 0 := by rw [←h₁, h₆]
    have h₇' : (c + a)^3 + r * (c + a)^2 + s * (c + a) + t = 0 := by rw [←h₁, h₇]
    have h₅'' : a^3 + b^3 + 3 * a^2 * b + 3 * a * b^2 + r * (a + b)^2 + s * (a + b) + t = 0 := by rw [add_pow_char_two h₅', h₂', h₃']; linarith
    have h₆'' : b^3 + c^3 + 3 * b^2 * c + 3 * b * c^2 + r * (b + c)^2 + s * (b + c) + t = 0 := by rw [add_pow_char_two h₆', h₃', h₄']; linarith
    have h₇'' : c^3 + a^3 + 3 * c^2 * a + 3 * c * a^2 + r * (c + a)^2 + s * (c + a) + t = 0 := by rw [add_pow_char_two h₇', h₄', h₂']; linarith
    sorry
```

Now, we have expanded the cubic terms in `h₅'`, `h₆'`, and `h₇'` and subtracted the corresponding equations `h₂'`, `h₃'`, and `h₄'`.

assistant:
1. Plan:
   - We can eliminate the cubic terms in `h₅'`, `h₆'`, and `h₇'` by subtracting the corresponding equations `h₂'`, `h₃'`, and `h₄'`. This will give us three new equations involving `r`, `s`, and `t`.
   - We can then solve the resulting system of linear equations to find the value of `t`.

1. Plan:
   - We have three equations involving `f`: `h₂`, `h₃`, and `h₄`. We can use `h₀` to substitute the expressions for `f a`, `f b`, and `f c` in terms of `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.
   - Similarly, we have three equations involving `g`: `h₅`, `h₆`, and `h₇`. We can use `h₁` to substitute the expressions for `g (a + b)`, `g (b + c)`, and `g (c + a)` in terms of `a`, `b`, `c`, `r`, `s`, and `t`.
   - Now we have a system of six equations with six unknowns: `a`, `b`, `c`, `r`, `s`, and `t`. We can solve this system to find the value of `t`.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
