I apologize for the mistake. It seems that `div_mul_cancel` is not needed in this case, as the goal has not reached a point where we can apply it. We will remove `div_mul_cancel` from the rewrite tactic.

Here is the corrected tactic step:

```lean

  ∑ k in (Finset.range n), (1 : ℝ) / ((k + 1) * (k + 2)) = n / (n + 1) := by

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 9, located on the tokens `div_mul_cancel`:

1. Plan for proceeding:

For the base case (n = 0), we need to show that the sum is 0. Since the range is empty when n = 0, the sum is 0. We will also show that the right-hand side is 0 when n = 0.

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We will prove this theorem by induction on `n`.

Base case (n = 0): We need to show that the sum is 0 when n = 0. In this case, the range is empty, so the sum is 0, and the right-hand side is also 0.

Inductive step: Assume the theorem holds for n, and we need to prove it for n + 1. We will consider the sum for n + 1 and rewrite it as the sum for n plus the additional term for n + 1. Then, we will use the inductive hypothesis to replace the sum for n with the corresponding expression. Finally, we will simplify the expression to show that it is equal to the right-hand side for n + 1.

2. Next tactic step:

We will start by applying induction on `n`.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
