I apologize for the confusion. The correct lemma to use here is `Nat.Modeq.symm` combined with `Nat.Modeq.mod_eq`. We will use these lemmas to show that `a % 16 = 5`.

Here is the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import Mathlib.NumberTheory.Modeq

theorem mathd_numbertheory_405
  (a b c : ℕ)
  (t : ℕ → ℕ)
  (h₀ : t 0 = 0)
  (h₁ : t 1 = 1)
  (h₂ : ∀ n > 1, t n = t (n - 2) + t (n - 1))
  (h₃ : a ≡ 5 [MOD 16])
  (h₄ : b ≡ 10 [MOD 16])
  (h₅ : c ≡ 15 [MOD 16]) :
  (t a + t b + t c) % 7 = 5 := by
  have a_mod_16 : a % 16 = 5 := Nat.Modeq.mod_eq (Nat.Modeq.symm h₃)
  have ta_mod_7 : t a % 7 = t 5 % 7 := by
    rw [← a_mod_16]
  sorry

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 11, located on the tokens `Nat.Modeq.mod_eq a 16 h₃`:

```
error: unknown constant 'Nat.Modeq.mod_eq'
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the confusion. I realize now that my previous approach was incorrect. Instead, we will use the `have` tactic to find the value of `t a` modulo 7 using the congruence property `h₃` and the recurrence relation `h₂`. We will first show that `a % 16 = 5` and then use this result to find `t a % 7`.

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. To fix this error, we will use the `rw` tactic with the lemma `Nat.mod_mod` in a different way. We will first rewrite `t a % 7` as `t (a % (16 * 7)) % 7` and `t 5 % 7` as `t (5 % (16 * 7)) % 7`. Then, we will use the equality `t (a % 16) = t (5 % 16)` to obtain the desired result `t a % 7 = t 5 % 7`.

I apologize for the mistake. To fix this error, we will first use the `congr_arg` tactic to obtain the equality `t (a % 16) = t (5 % 16)`. Then, we will apply the modulo operation to both sides of the equality to get the desired result `t a % 7 = t 5 % 7`.

1. Plan:
We will first use the congruence properties of `a`, `b`, and `c` to find the values of `t a`, `t b`, and `t c` modulo 7. We will use the recurrence relation `h₂` to compute these values. Then, we will add these values modulo 7 and show that the sum is congruent to 5 modulo 7.

2. Next tactic step:
We will first use the `have` tactic to find the value of `t a` modulo 7 using the congruence property `h₃`.

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_405
  (a b c : ℕ)
  (t : ℕ → ℕ)
  (h₀ : t 0 = 0)
  (h₁ : t 1 = 1)
  (h₂ : ∀ n > 1, t n = t (n - 2) + t (n - 1))
  (h₃ : a ≡ 5 [MOD 16])
  (h₄ : b ≡ 10 [MOD 16])
  (h₅ : c ≡ 15 [MOD 16]) :
  (t a + t b + t c) % 7 = 5 := by
  have ta_mod_7 : t a % 7 = t 5 % 7 := congr_arg t h₃
  sorry

=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_numbertheory_405
  (a b c : ℕ)
  (t : ℕ → ℕ)
  (h₀ : t 0 = 0)
  (h₁ : t 1 = 1)
  (h₂ : ∀ n > 1, t n = t (n - 2) + t (n - 1))
  (h₃ : a ≡ 5 [MOD 16])
  (h₄ : b ≡ 10 [MOD 16])
  (h₅ : c ≡ 15 [MOD 16]) :
  (t a + t b + t c) % 7 = 5 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
a b c : ℕ
t : ℕ → ℕ
h₀ : t 0 = 0
h₁ : t 1 = 1
h₂ : ∀ (n : ℕ), n > 1 → t n = t (n - 2) + t (n - 1)
h₃ : a ≡ 5 [MOD 16]
h₄ : b ≡ 10 [MOD 16]
h₅ : c ≡ 15 [MOD 16]
⊢ (t a + t b + t c) % 7 = 5
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
