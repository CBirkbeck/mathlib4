I apologize for the mistake. The error is caused by the typeclass instance problem when using the `Finset.sdiff` operation. We can fix this by explicitly providing the `ℤ` instance for the `DecidableEq` typeclass. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import data.finset.basic
import data.int.basic

theorem mathd_algebra_185
  (s: Finset ℤ)
  (f : ℤ → ℤ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = abs (x + 4))
  (h₁ : ∀ x, x ∈ s ↔ f x < 9) :
  s.card = 17 := by
  have h₂ : ∀ x, x ∈ s ↔ abs (x + 4) < 9 := by
    intro x
    simp [h₀ x, h₁ x]
  let s' := (Finset.range 18).map (fun x => Int.ofNat x - 13) \ (Finset.range 5).map (fun x => Int.ofNat x - 13) withDecidableEq
  have h₃ : s = s' := by
    ext x
    rw [h₂ x, Finset.mem_sdiff, Finset.mem_map, Finset.mem_map, Finset.mem_range, Finset.mem_range]
    split
    { intro hx
      use x + 13
      linarith }
    { rintro ⟨y, hy, rfl⟩
      linarith }
  rw [h₃]
  exact rfl
```

In this proof, we construct a new `Finset` called `s'` containing the integers in the range -13 to 4 by mapping the natural numbers in the corresponding ranges to integers using the `Int.ofNat` function and then subtracting the desired constant. We explicitly provide the `ℤ` instance for the `DecidableEq` typeclass when using the `Finset.sdiff` operation. Then, we show that `s` and `s'` are equal. Finally, we calculate the cardinality of `s'` to be 17.

I apologize for the mistake. The error is caused by the use of an unknown constant `Int.sub_nat_nat`. We should use the `Int.ofNat` function to convert natural numbers to integers and then subtract the desired constant. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

I apologize for the mistake. The error is caused by the incorrect usage of the `rw` tactic. We should use the `rw` tactic with square brackets enclosing the lemma. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import data.finset.basic
import data.int.basic

  s.card = 17 := by
  have h₂ : ∀ x, x ∈ s ↔ abs (x + 4) < 9 := by

    { intro hx
      linarith }

In this proof, we use the `rw [h₃]` tactic to rewrite the goal using the equality `s = s'`.

I apologize for the mistake. The error is caused by the incorrect usage of the `Finset.card_congr` lemma. Instead, we should construct a new `Finset` containing the integers in the desired range and then show that the two `Finset`s are equal. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean

  have h₂ : ∀ x, x ∈ s ↔ abs (x + 4) < 9 := by

1. Plan:
   - We have the condition `x ∈ s ↔ abs (x + 4) < 9`.
   - We want to find the number of elements in `s` that satisfy this condition.
   - We can find the range of `x` values that satisfy this condition.
   - We have `-9 < x + 4 < 9` which gives `-13 < x < 5`.
   - There are 17 integers in this range: -13, -12, ..., -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
   - We will show that all these integers are in `s` and no other integers are in `s`.
   - Then, we can conclude that the cardinality of `s` is 17.

I apologize for the mistake. The error is caused by the `rw` tactic not finding an instance of the pattern in the target expression. We can fix this by using the `simp` tactic with the lemma `h₀` instead of the `rw` tactic.

1. Plan:
   - We know that `f x = abs (x + 4)` and `x ∈ s ↔ f x < 9`.
   - We want to find the number of elements in `s` that satisfy these conditions.
   - We can rewrite the second condition using the first one: `x ∈ s ↔ abs (x + 4) < 9`.
   - Now, we can find the range of `x` values that satisfy this condition.
   - We have `-9 < x + 4 < 9` which gives `-13 < x < 5`.
   - There are 17 integers in this range: -13, -12, ..., -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
   - So, the cardinality of `s` is 17.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
