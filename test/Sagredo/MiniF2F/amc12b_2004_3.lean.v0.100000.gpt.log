assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that using `Eq.refl` is still causing a type mismatch. We can use the `congrArg` function to prove the equality step by step.

Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem amc12b_2004_p3
  (x y : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2^x * 3^y = 1296) :
  x + y = 8 := by
  have h₁ : 2^4 * 3^4 = 16 * 81 := by
    have h₁₁ : 2^4 = 16 := rfl
    have h₁₂ : 3^4 = 81 := rfl
    exact congrArg (fun a => a * 81) h₁₁
  have h₂ : 16 * 81 = 1296 := rfl
  have h₃ : 2^4 * 3^4 = 1296 := Eq.trans h₁ h₂
  sorry
```

user:
When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 5, located on the tokens `Eq.refl (2^4 * 3^4)`:

```
error: type mismatch
  Eq.refl (2 ^ 4 * 3 ^ 4)
has type
  2 ^ 4 * 3 ^ 4 = 2 ^ 4 * 3 ^ 4 : Prop
but is expected to have type
  2 ^ 4 * 3 ^ 4 = 16 * 81 : Prop
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that I made a mistake in using `eq.refl`. The correct function to use is `Eq.refl`. Let's correct the tactic step:

assistant:
I apologize for the oversight. It seems that using `rfl` directly is causing a type mismatch. To fix this, we can use the `eq.refl` function to provide the expected type explicitly.

Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem amc12b_2004_p3
  (x y : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2^x * 3^y = 1296) :
  x + y = 8 := by

  have h₂ : 16 * 81 = 1296 := rfl
  have h₃ : 2^4 * 3^4 = 1296 := Eq.trans h₁ h₂
  sorry

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `show` keyword is not working as expected in this context. Instead, we can use the `have` keyword to provide the intermediate steps.

Here's the corrected tactic step:

  (x y : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2^x * 3^y = 1296) :

I apologize for the error. It seems that Lean is still having trouble synthesizing the `Trans` instance for the `calc` step. To fix this, we can use the `show` keyword to provide the expected type for the intermediate step.

Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem amc12b_2004_p3
  (x y : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2^x * 3^y = 1296) :

assistant:
I apologize for the error. It seems that Lean is having trouble synthesizing the `Trans` instance for the `calc` step. To fix this, we can break the calculation into two separate `calc` steps.

Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem amc12b_2004_p3
  (x y : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2^x * 3^y = 1296) :

  have h₁ : 2^4 * 3^4 = 1296 := by
    calc 2^4 * 3^4 = 16 * 3^4 : rfl
    ... = 16 * 81 : rfl
    calc 16 * 81 = 1296 : rfl

I apologize for the error. To fix this, we will use the `calc` keyword to perform the arithmetic operations and prove that 2^4 * 3^4 = 1296.

  (x y : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2^x * 3^y = 1296) :

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:
   - First, we will factorize 1296 into its prime factors. 1296 = 2^4 * 3^4.
   - Then, we will use the fact that the prime factorization of a number is unique.
   - From the uniqueness of prime factorization, we can conclude that x = 4 and y = 4.
   - Finally, we will substitute x and y in the goal and prove that x + y = 8.

2. Next tactic step:
```lean
theorem amc12b_2004_p3
  (x y : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2^x * 3^y = 1296) :
  x + y = 8 := by
  have h₁ : 2^4 * 3^4 = 1296 := rfl
  sorry
```
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem amc12b_2004_p3
  (x y : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2^x * 3^y = 1296) :
  x + y = 8 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
x y : ℕ
h₀ : 2 ^ x * 3 ^ y = 1296
⊢ x + y = 8
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
