I apologize for the mistake. The error is caused by using `calc` without providing the necessary intermediate steps. We can fix this by using `linarith` directly to prove the goal. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem amc12a_2002_p12
  (f : ℝ → ℝ)
  (k : ℝ)
  (a b : ℕ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = x^2 - 63 * x + k)
  (h₁ : f a = 0 ∧ f b = 0)
  (h₂ : a ≠ b)
  (h₃ : Nat.Prime a ∧ Nat.Prime b) :
  k = 122 := by
  have ha : f ↑a = (↑a : ℝ) ^ 2 - 63 * (↑a : ℝ) + k := h₀ ↑a
  have hb : f ↑b = (↑b : ℝ) ^ 2 - 63 * (↑b : ℝ) + k := h₀ ↑b
  rw [h₁.left] at ha
  rw [h₁.right] at hb
  have hab : (↑b : ℝ) ^ 2 - (↑a : ℝ) ^ 2 = 63 * ((↑a : ℝ) - (↑b : ℝ)) := by
    rw [ha, hb]

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 15, located on the tokens `calc (↑b : ℝ) ^ 2 - (↑a : ℝ) ^ 2`:

```
error: invalid 'calc' step, failed to synthesize `Trans` instance

Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the confusion. The error is caused by trying to rewrite the goal using `ha` and `hb` directly. Instead, we should rewrite the goal using the expressions from `ha` and `hb` without the equalities. Here's the corrected tactic step:

I apologize for the mistake. The error is caused by using `rw` instead of `rw ←`. We should use `rw ←` to rewrite the goal using the left-hand side of `ha` and `hb`. Here's the corrected tactic step:

assistant:
1. Plan:
We have two equations `ha` and `hb` involving `k`. We can subtract `ha` from `hb` to eliminate `k` and obtain an equation relating `a` and `b`. Then, we can use the fact that `a` and `b` are distinct prime numbers to deduce the values of `a` and `b`. Finally, we can substitute these values back into either `ha` or `hb` to find the value of `k`.

2. Next tactic step:

assistant:
I apologize for the oversight. The error is caused by the subtraction operation between natural numbers and real numbers. We can fix this by first converting the natural numbers `a` and `b` to real numbers using `↑a` and `↑b` before performing the subtraction.

Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean

assistant:
1. Plan:
Since `f a = 0` and `f b = 0`, we can substitute `a` and `b` into the equation `f x = x^2 - 63 * x + k`. This will give us two equations involving `k`. We can then solve this system of equations to find the value of `k`. Since `a` and `b` are distinct prime numbers, we can use the properties of prime numbers to simplify the equations.

2. Next tactic step:

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
