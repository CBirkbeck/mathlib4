I apologize for the confusion. I made a mistake in the order of the arguments for the `List.any` function. The list should be the first argument, and the predicate should be the second argument. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean

  (rows seats : ℕ)
  (h₀ : rows * seats = 450)
  (h₁ : (rows + 5) * (seats - 3) = 450) :
  rows = 25 := by
  have factor_pairs : List (ℕ × ℕ) :=
    [(1, 450), (2, 225), (3, 150), (5, 90), (6, 75), (9, 50), (10, 45), (15, 30), (18, 25), (25, 18), (30, 15), (45, 10), (50, 9), (75, 6), (90, 5), (150, 3), (225, 2), (450, 1)]

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 9, located on the tokens `(fun pair => pair.fst * pair.snd = 450 ∧ (pair.fst + 5) * (pair.snd - 3) = 450)`:

```

Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the mistake. I used the wrong function in the proof. Instead of `List.exists_of_mem_map`, we should use `List.exists` to check if there exists a pair in `factor_pairs` that satisfies the conditions. Here's the corrected tactic step:

1. Plan for proceeding:

Now that we have the list of possible factor pairs for 450, we can iterate through the list and check which pair satisfies both equations. We can do this by using the `List.exists` function to check if there exists a pair `(r, s)` in `factor_pairs` such that `r * s = 450` and `(r + 5) * (s - 3) = 450`. If we find such a pair, we can conclude that `rows = r`.

2. Next tactic step:

Let's use the `List.exists` function to find the pair that satisfies both equations.

```lean
import data.nat.basic
import data.list.basic

theorem mathd_algebra_69
  (rows seats : ℕ)
  (h₀ : rows * seats = 450)

  have exists_pair : ∃ (pair : ℕ × ℕ), pair ∈ factor_pairs ∧ pair.fst * pair.snd = 450 ∧ (pair.fst + 5) * (pair.snd - 3) = 450 :=
    List.exists_of_mem_map (fun pair => pair.fst * pair.snd = 450 ∧ (pair.fst + 5) * (pair.snd - 3) = 450) factor_pairs

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We are given two equations:
(1) `rows * seats = 450`
(2) `(rows + 5) * (seats - 3) = 450`

We know that 450 can be factored into two natural numbers in the following ways: `(1, 450), (2, 225), (3, 150), (5, 90), (6, 75), (9, 50), (10, 45), (15, 30), (18, 25), (25, 18), (30, 15), (45, 10), (50, 9), (75, 6), (90, 5), (150, 3), (225, 2), (450, 1)`.

We can use these factor pairs to find the possible values of `rows` and `seats`. Then, we can plug these values into equation (2) and see which pair satisfies it. Once we find the pair that satisfies both equations, we can determine the value of `rows`.

2. Next tactic step:

First, let's create a list of possible factor pairs for 450.

```lean
import data.nat.basic

theorem mathd_algebra_69
  (rows seats : ℕ)
  (h₀ : rows * seats = 450)
  (h₁ : (rows + 5) * (seats - 3) = 450) :
  rows = 25 := by
  have factor_pairs : List (ℕ × ℕ) :=
    [(1, 450), (2, 225), (3, 150), (5, 90), (6, 75), (9, 50), (10, 45), (15, 30), (18, 25), (25, 18), (30, 15), (45, 10), (50, 9), (75, 6), (90, 5), (150, 3), (225, 2), (450, 1)]
  -- continue the proof

I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_algebra_69
  (rows seats : ℕ)
  (h₀ : rows * seats = 450)
  (h₁ : (rows + 5) * (seats - 3) = 450) :
  rows = 25 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
rows seats : ℕ
h₀ : rows * seats = 450
h₁ : (rows + 5) * (seats - 3) = 450
⊢ rows = 25
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
