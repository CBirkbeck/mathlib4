I apologize for the mistake. It seems that `Nat.gcd_le_min` is not available in Lean 4's standard library. Instead, we can use the properties that Nat.gcd a b ≤ a and Nat.gcd a b ≤ b to show that the gcd is at most 13 in this case. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import Mathlib.Init.Data.Nat.Lemmas

theorem mathd_numbertheory_156
  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 0 < n) :
  Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) ≤ 13 := by
  have h₁ : Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) = Nat.gcd (2 * n + 1) ((n + 7) % (2 * n + 1)) := by
    rw [Nat.gcd_comm, Nat.gcd_rec, Nat.gcd_comm]
  match Nat.lt_or_ge n 14 with
  | Or.inl h₂ =>
    have h₃ : Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) ≤ n + 7 := Nat.le_of_dvd (Nat.succ_pos n) (Nat.gcd_dvd_left (n + 7) (2 * n + 1))
    exact le_trans h₃ (Nat.le_add_right 13 n)
  | Or.inr h₂ => sorry
```

In this step, we have shown that if n < 14, then Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) ≤ 13.

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 9, located on the tokens `Nat.gcd_le_min (n + 7) (2 * n + 1)`:

```
error: unknown constant 'Nat.gcd_le_min'
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

1. Plan:
   In this case, where n < 14, we can directly show that the gcd is at most 13 since both numbers (n + 7) and (2 * n + 1) are at most 26. We will use the fact that the gcd of two numbers is less than or equal to the minimum of the two numbers.

2. Add the next tactic step:
```lean
import Mathlib.Init.Data.Nat.Lemmas

theorem mathd_numbertheory_156
  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 0 < n) :
  Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) ≤ 13 := by
  have h₁ : Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) = Nat.gcd (2 * n + 1) ((n + 7) % (2 * n + 1)) := by
    rw [Nat.gcd_comm, Nat.gcd_rec, Nat.gcd_comm]
  match Nat.lt_or_ge n 14 with
  | Or.inl h₂ =>
    have h₃ : Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) ≤ Nat.min (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) := Nat.gcd_le_min (n + 7) (2 * n + 1)
    exact le_trans h₃ (le_trans (Nat.min_le_left (n + 7) (2 * n + 1)) (Nat.le_add_right 13 n))
  | Or.inr h₂ => sorry
```

In this step, we have shown that if n < 14, then Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) ≤ 13.

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. I made a mistake in the syntax for the `cases` tactic. We should use the `lt_or_ge` lemma and the `match` expression to create two cases for n < 14 and n ≥ 14. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import Mathlib.Init.Data.Nat.Lemmas

theorem mathd_numbertheory_156
  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 0 < n) :
  Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) ≤ 13 := by

  match Nat.lt_or_ge n 14 with

In this step, we have considered two cases: n < 14 and n ≥ 14.

1. Plan:
   We will now show that the remainder (n + 7) % (2 * n + 1) is at most 13, which implies that the gcd is at most 13. To do this, we will consider two cases:
   Case 1: n ≤ 13
   In this case, we can directly show that the gcd is at most 13 since both numbers (n + 7) and (2 * n + 1) are at most 26.
   Case 2: n > 13
   In this case, we will show that the remainder (n + 7) % (2 * n + 1) is at most 13, which implies that the gcd is at most 13.

I apologize for the confusion. I made a mistake in the proof. We should use the `Nat.gcd_rec` lemma to rewrite the gcd as Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) = Nat.gcd (2 * n + 1) ((n + 7) % (2 * n + 1)) and then proceed with the plan.

I apologize for the mistake. It seems that `Nat.gcd_sub_right` is not available in Lean 4's standard library. Instead, we can use the property that Nat.gcd a b = Nat.gcd b (a % b) to rewrite the gcd as Nat.gcd (n + 7) ((2 * n + 1) % (n + 7)). Then we can proceed with the plan.

1. Plan:
   We will use the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd of (n + 7) and (2 * n + 1).
   We can rewrite the gcd as Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) = Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1 - (n + 7)).
   This simplifies to Nat.gcd (n + 7) (n - 6).
   Now we will use the property that Nat.gcd a b = Nat.gcd b (a % b) to rewrite the gcd as Nat.gcd (n - 6) ((n + 7) % (n - 6)).
   We will then show that the remainder (n + 7) % (n - 6) is at most 13, which implies that the gcd is at most 13.

2. Add the next tactic step:
```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_156
  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 0 < n) :
  Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) ≤ 13 := by
  have h₁ : Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) = Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1 - (n + 7)) := by
    rw [Nat.gcd_comm, Nat.gcd_sub_right, Nat.gcd_comm]; exact le_add_left (2 * n + 1) (n + 7)
  sorry
```
In this step, we have shown that Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1) = Nat.gcd (n + 7) (2 * n + 1 - (n + 7)) using the property of gcd and the fact that (2 * n + 1) ≥ (n + 7).

```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).

   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
