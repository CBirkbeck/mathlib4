assistant:
I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. I made another mistake in the arguments for `lt_trans`. I should have used `lt_trans h₆ h₇` for the first case, `h₇` and `h₈` for the second case, and `lt_trans h₆ (lt_trans h₇ h₈)` for the third case. Here is the corrected version of the tactic step:

1. Plan for proceeding:

We can proceed by using the given inequalities and equalities to derive relationships between the x values. We can start by rewriting the equalities h₉, h₁₀, h₁₁, and h₁₂ using the fact that a 1 > a 2 > a 3 > a 4. This will allow us to eliminate the absolute values. Then, we can try to manipulate these equalities to isolate x 1, x 2, x 3, and x 4, and show that they satisfy the desired conditions.

2. Next tactic step:

We will first rewrite the equalities h₉, h₁₀, h₁₁, and h₁₂ using the fact that a 1 > a 2 > a 3 > a 4.

user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```

  (h₁ : a 1 ≠ a 3)

  (h₆ : a 1 > a 2)
  (h₇ : a 2 > a 3)
  (h₈ : a 3 > a 4)
  (h₉ : abs (a 1 - a 2) * x 2 + abs (a 1 - a 3) * x 3 + abs (a 1 - a 4) * x 4 = 1)
  (h₁₀ : abs (a 2 - a 1) * x 1 + abs (a 2 - a 3) * x 3 + abs (a 2 - a 4) * x 4 = 1)
  (h₁₁ : abs (a 3 - a 1) * x 1 + abs (a 3 - a 2) * x 2 + abs (a 3 - a 4) * x 4 = 1)

  x 2 = 0 ∧ x 3 = 0 ∧ x 1 = 1 / abs (a 1 - a 4) ∧ x 4 = 1 / abs (a 1 - a 4) := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
x a : ℕ → ℝ
h₀ : a 1 ≠ a 2
h₁ : a 1 ≠ a 3
h₂ : a 1 ≠ a 4
h₃ : a 2 ≠ a 3
h₄ : a 2 ≠ a 4
h₅ : a 3 ≠ a 4
h₆ : a 1 > a 2
h₇ : a 2 > a 3
h₈ : a 3 > a 4
h₉ : abs (a 1 - a 2) * x 2 + abs (a 1 - a 3) * x 3 + abs (a 1 - a 4) * x 4 = 1
h₁₀ : abs (a 2 - a 1) * x 1 + abs (a 2 - a 3) * x 3 + abs (a 2 - a 4) * x 4 = 1
h₁₁ : abs (a 3 - a 1) * x 1 + abs (a 3 - a 2) * x 2 + abs (a 3 - a 4) * x 4 = 1
h₁₂ : abs (a 4 - a 1) * x 1 + abs (a 4 - a 2) * x 2 + abs (a 4 - a 3) * x 3 = 1
⊢ x 2 = 0 ∧ x 3 = 0 ∧ x 1 = 1 / abs (a 1 - a 4) ∧ x 4 = 1 / abs (a 1 - a 4)
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
