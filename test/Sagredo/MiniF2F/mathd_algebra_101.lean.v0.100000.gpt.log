I apologize for the confusion. I made a mistake in the proof. Instead of using `split`, we should use `apply And.intro` to construct the conjunction `x ≥ -2 ∧ x ≤ 7`. Here is the corrected proof:

```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring

theorem mathd_algebra_101
  (x : ℝ)
  (h₀ : x^2 - 5 * x - 4 ≤ 10) :
  x ≥ -2 ∧ x ≤ 7 := by
  have h₁ : x^2 - 5 * x - 14 ≤ 0 := by linarith
  by_cases x < -2
  focus
    have h₃ : (x - 7) * (x + 2) > 0 := by nlinarith
    exfalso
    linarith
  focus
    by_cases x > 7

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 18, located on the tokens `split`:

```

Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the confusion. I made a mistake in the proof. Instead of using `contradiction`, we should use `exfalso` to derive a contradiction from the fact that `(x - 7) * (x + 2) > 0` and `x^2 - 5 * x - 14 ≤ 0`. Here is the corrected proof:

You used byCases, but it looks like you maybe meant by_cases. Try that instead.

assistant:
1. Plan:
   We will now use the fact that the quadratic function `f(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14` can be factored as `(x - 7)(x + 2)`.
   We want to show that `(x - 7)(x + 2) ≤ 0` implies `x ≥ -2 ∧ x ≤ 7`.
   We will do this by considering two cases:
   - Case 1: `x < -2`. In this case, we will show that `(x - 7)(x + 2) > 0`, which contradicts `h₁`.
   - Case 2: `x > 7`. In this case, we will show that `(x - 7)(x + 2) > 0`, which also contradicts `h₁`.
   Since both cases lead to contradictions, we can conclude that `x ≥ -2 ∧ x ≤ 7`.

2. Add the next tactic step:
```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring

theorem mathd_algebra_101
  (x : ℝ)
  (h₀ : x^2 - 5 * x - 4 ≤ 10) :
  x ≥ -2 ∧ x ≤ 7 := by
  have h₁ : x^2 - 5 * x - 14 ≤ 0 := by linarith
  by_cases (x < -2) with h₂
  | case h₂ =>
    have h₃ : (x - 7) * (x + 2) > 0 := by nlinarith
    contradiction
  | case no_h₂ =>
    by_cases (x > 7) with h₄
    | case h₄ =>
      have h₅ : (x - 7) * (x + 2) > 0 := by nlinarith
      contradiction
    | case no_h₄ =>
      split; linarith
```

user:
The goal state for the sorry on line 6 is:
```
x : ℝ
h₀ : x ^ 2 - 5 * x - 4 ≤ 10
h₁ : x ^ 2 - 5 * x - 14 ≤ 0
⊢ x ≥ -2 ∧ x ≤ 7
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
assistant:
1. Plan:
   We will use the fact that the quadratic function `f(x) = x^2 - 5x - 4` is a parabola that opens upwards.
   The inequality `f(x) ≤ 10` can be rewritten as `x^2 - 5x - 14 ≤ 0`.
   We can factor the quadratic as `(x - 7)(x + 2) ≤ 0`.
   Since the parabola opens upwards, the inequality holds when x is between the roots -2 and 7.
   Thus, we have `x ≥ -2 ∧ x ≤ 7`.

2. Add the next tactic step:
```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring

theorem mathd_algebra_101
  (x : ℝ)
  (h₀ : x^2 - 5 * x - 4 ≤ 10) :
  x ≥ -2 ∧ x ≤ 7 := by
  have h₁ : x^2 - 5 * x - 14 ≤ 0 := by linarith

user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_algebra_101
  (x : ℝ)
  (h₀ : x^2 - 5 * x - 4 ≤ 10) :
  x ≥ -2 ∧ x ≤ 7 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
x : ℝ
h₀ : x ^ 2 - 5 * x - 4 ≤ 10
⊢ x ≥ -2 ∧ x ≤ 7
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
