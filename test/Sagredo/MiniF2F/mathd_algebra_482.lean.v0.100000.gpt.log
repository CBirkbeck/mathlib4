I apologize for the mistake. The error occurs because we are trying to rewrite using `h₃'` and `h₄'`, but the rewrite tactic is not able to find the pattern in the target expression. Instead, we can use the `calc` tactic to rewrite the expressions step by step. Here's the corrected tactic step:

1. Plan:
   - Subtract the equation `h₃'` from the equation `h₄'` to eliminate `k`.
   - Simplify the resulting equation and factor it.
   - Use the fact that `m` and `n` are prime and not equal to each other to deduce that one of them must be 5 and the other must be 7 (or vice versa).
   - Finally, substitute either `m = 5` and `n = 7` or `m = 7` and `n = 5` back into one of the original quadratic equations (e.g., `h₃'`) to find the value of `k`, which should be 35.

The error is caused by the fact that we are trying to subtract a `ℕ` from an `ℝ`. To fix this error, we need to explicitly cast the natural numbers `m` and `n` to real numbers using `↑m` and `↑n` before performing the subtraction. Here's the corrected tactic step:

1. Plan:
   - First, we will use the fact that `f m = 0` and `f n = 0` to rewrite these equations using the definition of `f` given by `h₂`.
   - Then, we will have two quadratic equations in terms of `m` and `n`. We can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate `k`.
   - After simplifying the resulting equation, we will use the fact that `m` and `n` are prime and not equal to each other to deduce that one of them must be 5 and the other must be 7 (or vice versa).
   - Finally, we will substitute either `m = 5` and `n = 7` or `m = 7` and `n = 5` back into one of the original quadratic equations to find the value of `k`, which should be 35.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
