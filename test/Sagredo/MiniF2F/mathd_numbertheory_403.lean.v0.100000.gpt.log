I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `exact Eq.refl 270` tactic is also causing a timeout. In this case, we can use the `norm_num` tactic to establish the equality:

```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic

open_locale BigOperators

theorem mathd_numbertheory_403 :
  ∑ k in (Nat.properDivisors 198), k = 270 := by
  have h198 : 198 = 2 * 3^2 * 11 := by
    show 2 * 3^2 * 11 = 198
    rfl
  have hDivisors : Nat.properDivisors 198 = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 18, 22, 33, 66, 99} := sorry
  rw [hDivisors]
  norm_num
```

Please note that I've replaced the problematic tactic step with `norm_num`. The proof is still incomplete because we need to prove that `Nat.properDivisors 198` is equal to the given set. You can replace the `sorry` with a proof for this equality.

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 8, located on the tokens `Eq.refl 270`:

```
error: (deterministic) timeout at 'whnf', maximum number of heartbeats (200000) has been reached (use 'set_option maxHeartbeats <num>' to set the limit)
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems I made a mistake in suggesting the use of `←Finset.sum_singleton`. Instead, we can directly calculate the sum of the elements in the set:

```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic

open_locale BigOperators

theorem mathd_numbertheory_403 :
  ∑ k in (Nat.properDivisors 198), k = 270 := by
  have h198 : 198 = 2 * 3^2 * 11 := by

  rw [hDivisors]
  exact rfl
```

Please note that I've removed the problematic tactic step. The proof is still incomplete because we need to prove that `Nat.properDivisors 198` is equal to the given set. You can replace the `sorry` with a proof for this equality.

1. Plan for proceeding:

We know that 198 = 2 * 3^2 * 11. The proper divisors of 198 can be found by considering all the possible combinations of its prime factors. The proper divisors are:

1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 18, 22, 33, 66, 99

We can calculate the sum of these divisors:

1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 11 + 18 + 22 + 33 + 66 + 99 = 270

Now we will use this information to complete the proof.

2. Add the next tactic step to the proof:

```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic

open_locale BigOperators

theorem mathd_numbertheory_403 :
  ∑ k in (Nat.properDivisors 198), k = 270 := by
  have h198 : 198 = 2 * 3^2 * 11 := by
    show 2 * 3^2 * 11 = 198
    rfl
  have hDivisors : Nat.properDivisors 198 = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 18, 22, 33, 66, 99} := sorry
  rw [hDivisors, ←Finset.sum_singleton]
  exact rfl
```

Please note that I've added an import statement and opened the `BigOperators` locale to use the summation notation. The proof is still incomplete because we need to prove that `Nat.properDivisors 198` is equal to the given set. You can replace the `sorry` with a proof for this equality.
=====
user:
The goal state for the sorry on line 6 is:
```
h198 : 198 = 2 * 3 ^ 2 * 11
⊢ ∑ k in Nat.properDivisors 198, k = 270
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems I made another mistake. In this case, we can use the `show` tactic to establish the equality:

  have h198 : 198 = 2 * 3^2 * 11 := by

Apologies for the confusion. The `rfl` tactic is not appropriate here since it only works when both sides of the equality are definitionally equal. Instead, we can use the `calc` tactic to establish the equality:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_403 :
  ∑ k in (Nat.properDivisors 198), k = 270 := by
  have h198 : 198 = 2 * 3^2 * 11 := by
    calc 198 = 2 * 99 : rfl
         ... = 2 * (3^2 * 11) : rfl
  sorry

assistant:
To start the proof, we can use the `have` tactic to establish a fact about the prime factorization of 198. We know that 198 = 2 * 3^2 * 11. Let's use this fact in our proof:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_403 :
  ∑ k in (Nat.properDivisors 198), k = 270 := by
  have h198 : 198 = 2 * 3^2 * 11 := rfl
  sorry
```
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_numbertheory_403 :
  ∑ k in (Nat.properDivisors 198), k = 270 := by sorry
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
