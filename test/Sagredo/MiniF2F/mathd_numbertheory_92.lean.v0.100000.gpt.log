I apologize for the confusion. I made another mistake in my previous response. We should rewrite `1 * n` as `n` after rewriting `h₃` using `h₁`. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean

1. Plan:
   We have `h₃ : 1 * n % 17 % 17 = 7 * (5 * n % 17) % 17`. We can simplify the left side of the equation to `n % 17 % 17`. Then, we can use `h₁` to rewrite the right side of the equation as `(7 * 8) % 17`. This gives us the equation `n % 17 % 17 = 5`. Since `n % 17 % 17` is equivalent to `n % 17`, we can conclude that `n % 17 = 5`.

assistant:
1. Plan:
   We have `h₂ : 7 % 17 * (5 * n % 17) % 17 % 17 = 7 * (5 * n % 17) % 17`. We can now use the fact that `7 * 5 ≡ 1 (mod 17)` to simplify the left side of the equation. Since `7 % 17 * (5 * n % 17) % 17 % 17 = 7 * (5 * n % 17) % 17`, we can rewrite the left side as `(1 * n) % 17 % 17`. This simplifies to `n % 17 % 17`. Finally, we can use `h₁` to rewrite the right side of `h₂` as `(7 * 8) % 17 = 5`, which gives us the desired result `n % 17 = 5`.

assistant:
1. Plan:
   We have `7 * (5 * n % 17) % 17 = 7 * 8 % 17`. We can now use the property of modular arithmetic that states `(a * b) % n = ((a % n) * (b % n)) % n`. Applying this property to the left side of the equation, we get `(7 % 17 * (5 * n % 17) % 17) % 17 = 7 * 8 % 17`. Since 7 and 17 are coprime, we can simplify the left side to `(7 * (5 * n % 17)) % 17 = 7 * 8 % 17`. We can then apply the property again to the right side of the equation to get `(7 * (5 * n % 17)) % 17 = (7 * 8) % 17`. Finally, we can use the fact that `7 * 5 ≡ 1 (mod 17)` to conclude that `n % 17 = 5`.

assistant:
1. Plan:
   We know that `5 * n % 17 = 8`. We want to show that `n % 17 = 5`. Since we are working with modular arithmetic, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the modular inverse of 5 modulo 17. The modular inverse of 5 modulo 17 is 7, because 5 * 7 ≡ 1 (mod 17). So, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 7 and then reduce modulo 17 to get the desired result.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
