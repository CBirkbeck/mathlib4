assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. It seems that `nlinarith` is also unable to find the contradiction in this case. We can use the `interval_cases` tactic to handle the inequalities more effectively.

Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import tactic.interval_cases

theorem mathd_algebra_327
  (a : ℝ)
  (h₀ : 1 / 5 * abs (9 + 2 * a) < 1) :
  -7 < a ∧ a < -2 := by
  have h₁ : abs (9 + 2 * a) < 5 := by
    linarith
  cases lt_or_ge (9 + 2 * a) 0 with
  | inl h₂ => -- Case 1: 9 + 2 * a < 0
    have h₃ : 9 + 2 * a < 5 := by
      linarith
    have h₄ : a < -2 := by
      linarith
    interval_cases a using -7 -2 with h₂ h₄,
    exact And.intro h₂ h₄
  | inr h₂ => -- Case 2: 0 ≤ 9 + 2 * a
    sorry

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 14, located on the tokens `nlinarith`:

```

Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the mistake. It seems that `linarith` is still unable to find the contradiction in this case. We can use the `nlinarith` tactic, which is a more powerful version of `linarith` that can handle nonlinear arithmetic.

```lean

I apologize for the mistake. It seems that the `calc` tactic is unable to synthesize the `Trans` instance in this case. Instead, we can use the `linarith` tactic with an additional hypothesis to show `-7 < a`.

1. Plan:
   - We already have `a < -2` from the previous step.
   - Now, we need to show `-7 < a`. Since we have `9 + 2 * a < 0`, we can solve this inequality for `a` to get `-7 < a`.
   - With both `-7 < a` and `a < -2`, we can conclude that `-7 < a ∧ a < -2`.

2. Next tactic step:
```lean
theorem mathd_algebra_327
  (a : ℝ)

assistant:
1. Plan:
   - We already have `abs (9 + 2 * a) < 5` from the previous step.
   - Next, we can use the properties of absolute values to split this inequality into two cases:
     - Case 1: `9 + 2 * a < 5`
     - Case 2: `-(9 + 2 * a) < 5`
   - For Case 1, we can solve the inequality for `a` to get `a < -2`.
   - For Case 2, we can solve the inequality for `a` to get `-7 < a`.
   - Finally, we can combine the results of Case 1 and Case 2 to conclude that `-7 < a ∧ a < -2`.

     - Case 1: `9 + 2 * a < 5`

user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_algebra_327
  (a : ℝ)
  (h₀ : 1 / 5 * abs (9 + 2 * a) < 1) :
  -7 < a ∧ a < -2 := by sorry

The goal state is currently:
```
a : ℝ
h₀ : 1 / 5 * abs (9 + 2 * a) < 1
⊢ -7 < a ∧ a < -2
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
