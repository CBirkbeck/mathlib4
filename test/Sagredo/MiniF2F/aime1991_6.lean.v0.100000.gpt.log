assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. I made another mistake in the previous response. We should first rewrite the sum in `h₀` using the properties of the floor function and the intervals of `k`. Then, we can split the sum into two parts and use the `finset.sum_union` lemma. Here's the corrected tactic step:

I apologize for the error. I misunderstood the goal state. We need to rewrite the sum in `h₀` using the properties of the floor function and the intervals of `k`. We can do this by splitting the sum in `h₀` into two parts and then using the `finset.sum_congr` lemma to rewrite the sums. Here's the corrected tactic step:

1. Plan for proceeding:

We will now prove that the sum can be rewritten as the sum of two parts, as described in the previous plan. We will use the properties of the floor function and the fact that k / 100 < 1/2 for k in Finset.Icc 19 49 and k / 100 ≥ 1/2 for k in Finset.Icc 50 91.

2. Next tactic step:

We will apply the `congr` tactic to change the goal to proving the equality of the two sums, and then use the `apply` tactic to apply the properties of the floor function.

The goal state for the sorry on line 5 is:
```

h₀ : ∑ k in Finset.Icc 19 91, ⌊r + ↑k / 100⌋ = 546
⊢ ∑ k in Finset.Icc 19 49, ⌊r⌋ + ∑ k in Finset.Icc 50 91, (⌊r⌋ + 1) = 546

=====
assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We will use the given information about the sum of the floor values and try to derive some properties about `r`. We can rewrite the sum as follows:

∑ k in Finset.Icc 19 91, ⌊r + k / 100⌋ = ∑ k in Finset.Icc 19 91, (⌊r⌋ + ⌊k / 100 + (r - ⌊r⌋)⌋)

Now, we can split the sum into two parts: one for k in Finset.Icc 19 49, and another for k in Finset.Icc 50 91. For the first part, k / 100 < 1/2, so ⌊k / 100 + (r - ⌊r⌋)⌋ = 0. For the second part, k / 100 ≥ 1/2, so ⌊k / 100 + (r - ⌊r⌋)⌋ = 1. Using this information, we can rewrite the given sum as:

∑ k in Finset.Icc 19 49, ⌊r⌋ + ∑ k in Finset.Icc 50 91, (⌊r⌋ + 1) = 546

We can now solve this equation to find the value of ⌊r⌋, and then use this information to find the value of ⌊100 * r⌋.

2. Next tactic step:

We will first rewrite the given sum using the properties we derived above.

user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```

  (r : ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∑ k in Finset.Icc (19 : ℕ) 91, (Int.floor (r + k / 100)) = 546) :
  Int.floor (100 * r) = 743 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
r : ℝ
h₀ : ∑ k in Finset.Icc 19 91, ⌊r + ↑k / 100⌋ = 546
⊢ ⌊100 * r⌋ = 743
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
