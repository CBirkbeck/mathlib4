I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `nat.prime_ne_zero` lemma is not available in the current context. We can use the `ne_of_gt` lemma along with the fact that 3 and 5 are greater than 0 to show that they are not equal to 0 in `ZMod 31`. Here's the updated proof with the fixed tactic step:

```lean

  (x y z : ZMod 31)
  (h₀ : x = (3 : ZMod 31)⁻¹)
  (h₁ : y = (5 : ZMod 31)⁻¹)
  (h₂ : z = (x + y)⁻¹) :
  z = 29 := by
  have h₃ : x + y = (3 : ZMod 31)⁻¹ + (5 : ZMod 31)⁻¹ := by rw [h₀, h₁]

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 9, located on the tokens `nat.prime_ne_zero`:

```
error: unknown identifier 'nat.prime_ne_zero'

Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `dec_trivial` tactic is not available in the current context. We can use the `nat.prime_ne_zero` lemma to show that 3 and 5 are not equal to 0 in `ZMod 31`. Here's the updated proof with the fixed tactic step:

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `inv_mul_distrib` lemma is not available in the current context either. We can manually prove the required equality using basic algebraic manipulations. Here's the updated proof with the fixed tactic step:

I apologize for the error. It seems that Lean is having trouble interpreting the inverse notation for natural numbers. We can fix this by explicitly converting the natural numbers to `ZMod 31` before taking the inverse. Here's the updated proof with the fixed tactic step:

1. Plan:
   - We have already substituted the values of x and y using the given equalities h₀ and h₁, and we have the sum x + y.
   - Next, we will compute the sum 3⁻¹ + 5⁻¹.
   - Then, we will substitute the value of z using the given equality h₂.
   - Finally, we will simplify the expression and show that z = 29.

2. Next tactic step:
```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.GroupWithZero.Power
import Mathlib.Data.Zmod.Basic

theorem mathd_numbertheory_232
  (x y z : ZMod 31)
  (h₀ : x = 3⁻¹)
  (h₁ : y = 5⁻¹)
  (h₂ : z = (x + y)⁻¹) :
  z = 29 := by
  have h₃ : x + y = 3⁻¹ + 5⁻¹ := by rw [h₀, h₁]
  have h₄ : 3⁻¹ + 5⁻¹ = (3 * 5)⁻¹ * (3 + 5) := by
    rw [←mul_inv', mul_add]

The goal state is currently:
```
x y z : ZMod 31
h₀ : x = 3⁻¹
h₁ : y = 5⁻¹
h₂ : z = (x + y)⁻¹
h₃ : x + y = 3⁻¹ + 5⁻¹
⊢ z = 29
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `calc` tactic is not working as expected in this case. We can use the `have` tactic to create intermediate equalities and then use the `rw` tactic to rewrite the goal. Here's the updated proof with the fixed tactic step:

import Mathlib.Algebra.GroupWithZero.Power
import Mathlib.Data.Zmod.Basic

theorem mathd_numbertheory_232
  (x y z : ZMod 31)

assistant:
My apologies for the error. It seems that the `rw` tactic is not able to rewrite the goal directly with the given equalities. Instead, we can use the `calc` tactic to perform the substitutions and computations step by step. Here's the updated proof with the fixed tactic step:

theorem mathd_numbertheory_232

  (h₂ : z = (x + y)⁻¹) :
  z = 29 := by
  calc z = (x + y)⁻¹ : h₂

I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
