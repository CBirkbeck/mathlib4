I apologize for the confusion. It seems I made another mistake. We can manually prove the desired property using basic arithmetic without using the `Nat.succ_eq_add_one` lemma. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean

  3 ∣ (2^(2 * n + 1) + 1) := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl

    rw [h1]
    have h2 : 2 ^ (2 * n + 3) = 2 ^ (2 * n + 1) * 2 ^ 2 := by
      have h2a : 2 * n + 3 = 2 * n + 1 + 2 := rfl

I apologize for the mistake. The error is due to the use of `Nat.pow_add`, which is not a valid constant in Lean 4. Instead, we can use `Nat.pow_add_exp` to achieve the desired result. Here's the corrected tactic step:

1. Plan for proceeding:

Now we have the goal `3 ∣ 2 ^ (2 * n + 3) + 1`. We will rewrite this expression using the fact that `2 ^ (2 * n + 3) = 2 ^ (2 * n + 1) * 2 ^ 2`. Then, we will use the induction hypothesis `ih : 3 ∣ 2 ^ (2 * n + 1) + 1` to rewrite the goal in terms of `ih`. Finally, we will use properties of divisibility to show that the goal is divisible by 3.

2. Next tactic step:

```lean
theorem induction_divisibility_3div2tooddnp1
  (n : ℕ) :
  3 ∣ (2^(2 * n + 1) + 1) := by
  induction n with

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We want to show that `3 ∣ 2^(2 * (n + 1) + 1) + 1`. We can rewrite this as `3 ∣ 2^(2 * n + 3) + 1`. Notice that `2^(2 * n + 3) = 2^(2 * n + 1) * 2^2`. We will use the induction hypothesis `ih : 3 ∣ 2^(2 * n + 1) + 1` to rewrite the goal in a more convenient form. We will then use properties of divisibility to show that the goal is divisible by 3.

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We will use induction on `n`. The base case is when `n = 0`. In this case, we have `2^(2 * 0 + 1) + 1 = 2^1 + 1 = 3`, which is clearly divisible by 3.

For the induction step, we assume that the statement holds for `n`, i.e., `3 ∣ 2^(2 * n + 1) + 1`. We want to show that the statement also holds for `n + 1`, i.e., `3 ∣ 2^(2 * (n + 1) + 1) + 1`. We can rewrite the goal as `3 ∣ 2^(2 * n + 3) + 1`. We will manipulate the expression and use the induction hypothesis to show that it is divisible by 3.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
