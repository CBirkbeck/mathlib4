assistant:
I apologize once again for the confusion. It seems I made another mistake in using the `Finset.sum_Icc_eq_sum_range` lemma, which does not exist. We can instead use the `finset.sum_range_succ_comm` lemma to rewrite the sum explicitly. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import data.finset.basic

theorem mathd_numbertheory_24 :
  (∑ k in (Finset.Icc 1 9), 11^k) % 100 = 59 := by
  have sum_explicit : (∑ k in (Finset.Icc 1 9), 11^k) = 11^1 + 11^2 + 11^3 + 11^4 + 11^5 + 11^6 + 11^7 + 11^8 + 11^9 := by
    rw [Finset.sum_range_succ_comm];
    sorry
```

Now, please provide the next tactic step.

user:
When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 4, located on the tokens `Finset.sum_Icc_eq_sum_range`:

```
error: unknown constant 'Finset.sum_Icc_eq_sum_range'
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the confusion again. It seems I made another mistake in using the `finset.sum_eq_sum_iff` lemma, which does not exist. We can instead use the `finset.sum_range_succ` lemma to rewrite the sum explicitly. Here's the corrected tactic step:

Apologies for the confusion. It seems I made a mistake in using the `finset.sum_congr` lemma. Instead, we can use the `finset.sum_eq_sum_iff` lemma, which states that if two sums are equal for all elements in the sets, then the sums are equal. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import data.finset.basic

theorem mathd_numbertheory_24 :
  (∑ k in (Finset.Icc 1 9), 11^k) % 100 = 59 := by
  have sum_explicit : (∑ k in (Finset.Icc 1 9), 11^k) = 11^1 + 11^2 + 11^3 + 11^4 + 11^5 + 11^6 + 11^7 + 11^8 + 11^9 := by
    rw [←finset.sum_eq_sum_iff];
    sorry
```

Now, please provide the next tactic step.

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:
   We will prove the equality by showing that both sides of the equation are equal for each element in the `Finset.Icc 1 9`. We can use the `finset.sum_congr` lemma to show that the sum on both sides is equal for each element in the set. The `finset.sum_congr` lemma states that if two sets are equal and the sum of a function applied to each element in the sets is equal, then the sums are equal.

2. Next tactic step:

```lean
import data.finset.basic

theorem mathd_numbertheory_24 :
  (∑ k in (Finset.Icc 1 9), 11^k) % 100 = 59 := by
  have sum_explicit : (∑ k in (Finset.Icc 1 9), 11^k) = 11^1 + 11^2 + 11^3 + 11^4 + 11^5 + 11^6 + 11^7 + 11^8 + 11^9 := by
    apply finset.sum_congr;
    sorry
```

Now, please provide the next tactic step.
=====
user:
The goal state for the sorry on line 4 is:
```
⊢ ∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 9, 11 ^ k = 11 ^ 1 + 11 ^ 2 + 11 ^ 3 + 11 ^ 4 + 11 ^ 5 + 11 ^ 6 + 11 ^ 7 + 11 ^ 8 + 11 ^ 9
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
assistant:
To start the proof, let's first compute the sum explicitly and then reduce it modulo 100. We can use the `have` tactic to compute the sum and store it in a variable. Here's the first step:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_24 :
  (∑ k in (Finset.Icc 1 9), 11^k) % 100 = 59 := by
  have sum_explicit : (∑ k in (Finset.Icc 1 9), 11^k) = 11^1 + 11^2 + 11^3 + 11^4 + 11^5 + 11^6 + 11^7 + 11^8 + 11^9 := by
    sorry
```

Now, please provide the next tactic step.
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_numbertheory_24 :
  (∑ k in (Finset.Icc 1 9), 11^k) % 100 = 59 := by sorry
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
