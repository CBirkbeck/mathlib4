assistant:
I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. I made a mistake in the updated code again. This time, let's fix the error by working with natural numbers and then converting them to real numbers when necessary.

Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import data.real.basic
import algebra.big_operators.basic

open Finset

theorem amc12a_2010_p22
  (x : ℝ) :
  49 ≤ ∑ k in Finset.Icc (1:ℕ) 119, abs (↑k * x - 1) := by
  have h_abs_ge : ∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 119, abs (↑(k : ℝ) * x - 1) ≥ ∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 119, (↑(k : ℝ) * x - 1) := by
    apply sum_le_sum
    intro k hk
    apply abs_nonneg
  -- continue the proof
```

In this step, we have established the inequality between the sums using the `sum_le_sum` lemma and the non-negativity of the absolute value function.

user:
When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 4, located on the tokens `Finset.Icc 1 119`:

```
error: failed to synthesize instance
  LocallyFiniteOrder ℝ
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

assistant:
I apologize for the oversight. The error occurs because Lean is unable to synthesize an instance of `LocallyFiniteOrder ℝ`. This is because the `Finset.Icc` function requires a locally finite order on the type, which is not available for real numbers. To fix this error, we can work with natural numbers instead of real numbers and then convert them to real numbers when necessary.

Here's the updated tactic step:

```lean
import data.real.basic
import algebra.big_operators.basic

open Finset

theorem amc12a_2010_p22
  (x : ℝ) :

1. Plan for proceeding:

We can use the following inequality:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{119} \left| kx - 1 \right| \ge \sum_{k=1}^{119} \left( kx - 1 \right)
$$

This inequality holds because the absolute value function is non-negative, i.e., $|a| \ge a$ for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$.

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side of the inequality:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{119} \left( kx - 1 \right) = \sum_{k=1}^{119} kx - \sum_{k=1}^{119} 1 = x \sum_{k=1}^{119} k - 119
$$

Using the formula for the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers, $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, we get:
$$
x \sum_{k=1}^{119} k - 119 = x \cdot \frac{119 \cdot 120}{2} - 119
$$

Now, we want to show that:
$$
x \cdot \frac{119 \cdot 120}{2} - 119 \ge 49
$$

This inequality holds for $x \ge \frac{168}{119 \cdot 60}$.

So, the plan is to first establish the inequality between the sums, then simplify the right-hand side, and finally show that the inequality holds for $x \ge \frac{168}{119 \cdot 60}$.

2. Add the next tactic step to the proof:

```lean
import data.real.basic
import algebra.big_operators.basic

open Finset

theorem amc12a_2010_p22
  (x : ℝ) :
  49 ≤ ∑ k in Finset.Icc (1:ℕ) 119, abs (↑k * x - 1) := by
  have h_abs_ge : ∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 119, abs (↑k * x - 1) ≥ ∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 119, (↑k * x - 1) := by
    apply sum_le_sum
    intro k hk
    apply abs_nonneg
  -- continue the proof
```

In this step, we have established the inequality between the sums using the `sum_le_sum` lemma and the non-negativity of the absolute value function.
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem amc12a_2010_p22
  (x : ℝ) :
  49 ≤ ∑ k in Finset.Icc (1:ℕ) 119, abs (↑k * x - 1) := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
x : ℝ
⊢ 49 ≤ ∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 119, abs (↑k * x - 1)
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
