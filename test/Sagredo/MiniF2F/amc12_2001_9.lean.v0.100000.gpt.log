I apologize for the confusion. The error is due to the incorrect use of `congrArg`. We should use `rw` instead of `congrArg` to rewrite the goal using `h₀`. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem amc12_2001_p9
  (f : ℝ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (x * y) = f x / y)
  (h₁ : f 500 = 3) : f 600 = 5 / 2 := by
  have h₂ : f 600 = f (500 * (6/5)) := by
    rw [←h₀ 500 (by norm_num) (6/5) (by norm_num)]
```

I apologize for the confusion. It seems I misunderstood the error message earlier. In Lean 4, we should use `by norm_num` instead of `by normNum`. Here's the corrected tactic step:

  (h₀ : ∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (x * y) = f x / y)

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. The `rfl` tactic is not appropriate here since the equality is not a definitional one. Instead, we can use the `congrArg` tactic along with `h₀` to rewrite the expression for `f 600`.

Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem amc12_2001_p9
  (f : ℝ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (x * y) = f x / y)
  (h₁ : f 500 = 3) : f 600 = 5 / 2 := by
  have h₂ : f 600 = f (500 * (6/5)) := by
    apply congrArg
    exact h₀ 500 (by normNum) (6/5) (by normNum)
```

assistant:
1. Plan:
We can use the property `h₀` to rewrite the expression for `f 600` in terms of `f 500`. We know that `600 = 500 * (6/5)`, so we can apply `h₀` with `x = 500` and `y = 6/5`. Since both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, we can rewrite `f 600` as `f 500 / (6/5)`. Then, we can use `h₁` to substitute `f 500` with `3`. Finally, we can simplify the expression `3 / (6/5)` to `5/2`.

2. Next tactic step:
```lean
theorem amc12_2001_p9
  (f : ℝ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (x * y) = f x / y)
  (h₁ : f 500 = 3) : f 600 = 5 / 2 := by
  have h₂ : f 600 = f (500 * (6/5)) := rfl
```
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem amc12_2001_p9
  (f : ℝ → ℝ)
  (h₀ : ∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (x * y) = f x / y)
  (h₁ : f 500 = 3) : f 600 = 5 / 2 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
f : ℝ → ℝ
h₀ : ∀ (x : ℝ), x > 0 → ∀ (y : ℝ), y > 0 → f (x * y) = f x / y
h₁ : f 500 = 3
⊢ f 600 = 5 / 2
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
