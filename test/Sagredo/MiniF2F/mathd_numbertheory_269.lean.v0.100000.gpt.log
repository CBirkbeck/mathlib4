I apologize for the confusion. It seems that using `← Nat.mul_mod` directly in the `rw` tactic is not working as expected. Let's use a different approach by calculating the remainder of each term when divided by 100 manually:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_269 :
  (2005^2 + 2005^0 + 2005^0 + 2005^5) % 100 = 52 := by
  change (2005 * 2005 + 1 + 1 + 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005) % 100 = 52
  change ((2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) + 1 + 1 + (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100)) % 100 = 52
```

Now, the goal state should look like this:

`((2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) + 1 + 1 + (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100)) % 100 = 52`

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 6, located on the tokens `← Nat.mul_mod`:

```
error: tactic 'rewrite' failed, did not find instance of the pattern in the target expression
  ?a % ?n * (?b % ?n) % ?n
⊢ (2005 * 2005 + 1 + 1 + 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005) % 100 = 52
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that using `Nat.mul_mod` directly in the `rw` tactic is not working as expected. Let's use a different approach by first calculating the remainder of 2005 when divided by 100 and then using it in the main proof. Here's the updated code:

```lean
def remainder_2005 : ℕ := 2005 % 100

theorem mathd_numbertheory_269 :
  (2005^2 + 2005^0 + 2005^0 + 2005^5) % 100 = 52 := by

  rw [← Nat.mul_mod, ← Nat.mul_mod, ← Nat.mul_mod, ← Nat.mul_mod, remainder_2005]
```

Now, the goal state should look like this:

`((remainder_2005) * (remainder_2005) + 1 + 1 + (remainder_2005) * (remainder_2005) * (remainder_2005) * (remainder_2005) * (remainder_2005)) % 100 = 52`

1. Plan for proceeding:

We want to prove that `(2005^2 + 2005^0 + 2005^0 + 2005^5) % 100 = 52`. We have already expanded the expression to `(2005 * 2005 + 1 + 1 + 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005) % 100 = 52`. Now, we can proceed as follows:

- Calculate the remainder of each term when divided by 100.
- Add the remainders and calculate the remainder of the sum when divided by 100.
- Show that the final remainder is equal to 52.

2. Next tactic step:

Let's calculate the remainder of each term when divided by 100 using the `mod` function:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_269 :
  (2005^2 + 2005^0 + 2005^0 + 2005^5) % 100 = 52 := by
  change (2005 * 2005 + 1 + 1 + 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005) % 100 = 52
  rw [Nat.mul_mod, Nat.mul_mod, Nat.mul_mod, Nat.mul_mod]
```

Now, the goal state should look like this:

`((2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) + 1 + 1 + (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100) * (2005 % 100)) % 100 = 52`

The goal state is currently:
```
⊢ (2005 * 2005 + 1 + 1 + 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005) % 100 = 52
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that using the lemma `pow_zero_2005` directly in the `rw` tactic is not working as expected. Let's use a different approach by expanding the expression manually:

Now, the goal state should look like this:

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that using `Nat.pow_zero 2005` directly in the `rw` tactic is not working as expected. Let's use a different approach by first proving a separate lemma for `2005^0 = 1` and then using it in the main proof. Here's the updated code:

```lean
lemma pow_zero_2005 : 2005^0 = 1 := by
  rw [Nat.pow_zero]

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that `Nat.pow_zero` is not the correct lemma to use here. Let's use `Nat.pow_zero 2005` instead to explicitly rewrite the expression. Here's the corrected proof:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_269 :
  (2005^2 + 2005^0 + 2005^0 + 2005^5) % 100 = 52 := by

I apologize for the mistake. It seems that `pow_zero` is not recognized as a lemma in Lean 4. Instead, we can use `Nat.pow_zero` to rewrite the expression. Here's the corrected proof:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_269 :
  (2005^2 + 2005^0 + 2005^0 + 2005^5) % 100 = 52 := by

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. In Lean 4, we use `by` instead of `begin ... end`. Let's correct the proof by replacing `begin ... end` with `by`:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_269 :
  (2005^2 + 2005^0 + 2005^0 + 2005^5) % 100 = 52 := by
  rw [pow_two, pow_zero, pow_zero, pow_five]
```

Now, the goal state should look like this:

You used begin, but it looks like you maybe meant aesop. Try that instead.

=====
assistant:
To begin, let's replace the `sorry` with a `begin ... end` block and start by expanding the powers of 2005:

```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_269 :
  (2005^2 + 2005^0 + 2005^0 + 2005^5) % 100 = 52 := by
  begin
    rw [pow_two, pow_zero, pow_zero, pow_five],
  end
```

Now, the goal state should look like this:

`(2005 * 2005 + 1 + 1 + 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005 * 2005) % 100 = 52`
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_numbertheory_269 :
  (2005^2 + 2005^0 + 2005^0 + 2005^5) % 100 = 52 := by sorry
```

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
