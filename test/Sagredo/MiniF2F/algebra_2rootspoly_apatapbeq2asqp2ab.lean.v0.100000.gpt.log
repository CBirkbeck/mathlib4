1. Plan for proceeding:

Since the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation are already equal, we can proceed as follows:
- Apply the reflexivity of equality to complete the proof.

2. Next tactic step:

```lean
theorem algebra_2rootspoly_apatapbeq2asqp2ab
  (a b : ℂ) :
  (a + a) * (a + b) = 2 * a^2 + 2 * (a * b) := by
  rw [add_mul]
  simp only [mul_add]
  simp only [add_assoc]
  rw [mul_comm a a, pow_two a, mul_comm a b]
  simp only [mul_two, add_add_add_comm]
  refl
```

This step applies the reflexivity of equality to complete the proof.

I apologize for the mistake. It seems that the `rw [mul_two, mul_two, add_add_add_comm]` tactic is not working as expected. We can use the `simp only` tactic instead to factor out the common factor of 2 from the left-hand side of the equation and rearrange the terms to match the right-hand side. Here's the corrected proof with the fixed tactic step:

```lean
theorem algebra_2rootspoly_apatapbeq2asqp2ab
  (a b : ℂ) :
  (a + a) * (a + b) = 2 * a^2 + 2 * (a * b) := by
  rw [add_mul]
  simp only [mul_add]
  simp only [add_assoc]
  rw [mul_comm a a, pow_two a, mul_comm a b]
  simp only [mul_two, add_add_add_comm]
```

This step factors out the common factor of 2 from the left-hand side of the equation and rearranges the terms to match the right-hand side.

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 8, located on the tokens `mul_two`:

I apologize for the mistake. It seems that the `rw [add_assoc, add_assoc a (a * b)]` tactic is not working as expected. We can use the `simp only` tactic instead to combine like terms on the left-hand side of the equation. Here's the corrected proof with the fixed tactic step:

I apologize for the mistake. It seems that the `rw [mul_add, mul_add]` tactic is not working as expected. Instead, we can use two separate `rw` tactics to expand both terms on the left-hand side of the equation. Here's the corrected proof with the fixed tactic step:

```lean

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
