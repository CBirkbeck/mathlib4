I apologize for the mistake. In Lean 4, we should use the `rw` tactic with square brackets around the lemma. Here's the corrected code:

```lean
theorem amc12a_2020_p21
  (S : Finset ℕ)
  (h₀ : ∀ (n : ℕ), n ∈ S ↔ 5 ∣ n ∧ Nat.lcm 5! n = 5 * Nat.gcd 10! n) :
  S.card = 48 := by
  let T := Finset.image (fun d => 5 * d) (Nat.divisors (10! / 5!))
  have h₁ : ∀ n, n ∈ S ↔ n ∈ T := by
    intro n
    apply Iff.intro
    focus
      intro hS
      have h₂ : 5 ∣ n ∧ Nat.lcm 5! n = 5 * Nat.gcd 10! n := Iff.mp (h₀ n) hS
      obtain ⟨d, hd⟩ := h₂.left
      have h₃ : d ∈ Nat.divisors (10! / 5!) := sorry
      rw [hd]
      exact Finset.mem_image_of_mem (fun d => 5 * d) h₃
    focus
      intro hT
      sorry
  sorry
```

This should fix the error, and now we can proceed with the proof.

Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the mistake. We should use `hd` to rewrite `n` as `5 * d` and then apply `Finset.mem_image_of_mem`. Here's the corrected code:

1. Plan:
We will use the property `h₂` to show that `n` is of the form `5 * d` where `d` is a divisor of `10! / 5!`. Then, we will use the definition of `T` to show that `n ∈ T`.

2. Next tactic step:
Let's use the property `h₂` to show that `n` is of the form `5 * d` where `d` is a divisor of `10! / 5!`.

Now we need to prove that `d` is a divisor of `10! / 5!`.

1. Plan:
We will show that `n ∈ S ↔ n ∈ T` by splitting the biconditional into two implications and proving them separately. First, we will show that if `n ∈ S`, then `n ∈ T`. We will use the property `h₀` to show that `n` must be of the form `5 * d` where `d` is a divisor of `10! / 5!`. Then, we will show that if `n ∈ T`, then `n ∈ S`. We will use the definition of `T` to show that `n` satisfies the property `h₀`.

assistant:
1. Plan:
We know that the elements of `S` are divisible by 5 and have a certain property related to their least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD) with factorials. We can use this information to find the possible elements of `S` and count them. Specifically, we can show that the elements of `S` are of the form `5 * d` where `d` is a divisor of `10! / 5!`. Then, we can count the number of divisors of `10! / 5!` to find the cardinality of `S`.

2. Next tactic step:
Let's start by defining the set `T` of numbers of the form `5 * d` where `d` is a divisor of `10! / 5!`. We will then show that `S` and `T` are equal, and finally count the elements of `T`.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
