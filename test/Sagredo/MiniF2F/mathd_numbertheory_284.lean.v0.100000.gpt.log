assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `interval_cases!` tactic is not available in Lean 4. Instead, we can use the `interval_cases` tactic and provide the upper bound using the `using` keyword followed by the upper bound expression. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import tactic.interval_cases

theorem mathd_numbertheory_284
  (a b : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9)
  (h₁ : 10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)) :
  10 * a + b = 18 := by
  have h₂ : 8 * a = b := by
    linarith
  interval_cases a using h₀.left.right.left with
  | 1 => sorry
  | 2 => sorry
  | 3 => sorry
  | 4 => sorry
  | 5 => sorry
  | 6 => sorry
  | 7 => sorry
  | 8 => sorry
  | 9 => sorry
```

user:
When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 8, located on the tokens `interval_cases!`:

```
error: unknown tactic
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
You used interval_cases!, but it looks like you maybe meant . Try that instead.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. I misunderstood the syntax for providing the upper bound to the `interval_cases` tactic. We can fix this by using the `interval_cases!` tactic, which automatically infers the bounds from the context. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import tactic.interval_cases

theorem mathd_numbertheory_284
  (a b : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9)
  (h₁ : 10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)) :
  10 * a + b = 18 := by
  have h₂ : 8 * a = b := by
    linarith
  interval_cases! a with
  | 1 => sorry
  | 2 => sorry
  | 3 => sorry
  | 4 => sorry
  | 5 => sorry
  | 6 => sorry
  | 7 => sorry
  | 8 => sorry
  | 9 => sorry
```

assistant:
I apologize for the oversight. The `interval_cases` tactic requires an explicit upper bound for the variable. We can fix this by providing the upper bound from the hypothesis `h₀`. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import tactic.interval_cases

theorem mathd_numbertheory_284
  (a b : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9)
  (h₁ : 10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)) :
  10 * a + b = 18 := by
  have h₂ : 8 * a = b := by
    linarith
  interval_cases a using h₀.left.right.left with
  | 1 => sorry
  | 2 => sorry
  | 3 => sorry
  | 4 => sorry
  | 5 => sorry
  | 6 => sorry
  | 7 => sorry
  | 8 => sorry
  | 9 => sorry
```

1. Plan:
   - We have the equation `8 * a = b`. We will now find the unique values of `a` and `b` that satisfy this equation, given the constraints on `a` and `b`.
   - We will use the `interval_cases` tactic to consider all possible values of `a` between 1 and 9.
   - For each value of `a`, we will compute the corresponding value of `b` and check if it satisfies the constraints on `b`.
   - We will find that `a = 2` and `b = 4` are the unique values that satisfy the equation and the constraints.
   - Then we can substitute these values back into the equation `10 * a + b` to get `10 * 2 + 4 = 18`.

2. Next tactic step:
```lean
import tactic.interval_cases

theorem mathd_numbertheory_284
  (a b : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9)
  (h₁ : 10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)) :
  10 * a + b = 18 := by
  have h₂ : 8 * a = b := by
    linarith
  interval_cases a with
  | 1 => sorry
  | 2 => sorry
  | 3 => sorry
  | 4 => sorry
  | 5 => sorry
  | 6 => sorry
  | 7 => sorry
  | 8 => sorry
  | 9 => sorry
```

user:
The goal state for the sorry on line 8 is:
```
a b : ℕ
h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9
h₁ : 10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)
h₂ : 8 * a = b
⊢ 10 * a + b = 18
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
assistant:
1. Plan:
   - We have the equation `10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)`. We can simplify this equation to `8 * a = b`.
   - Since `a` is between 1 and 9, and `b` is less than or equal to 9, we can find the unique values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the equation `8 * a = b`.
   - We will find that `a = 2` and `b = 4` are the unique values that satisfy the equation.
   - Then we can substitute these values back into the equation `10 * a + b` to get `10 * 2 + 4 = 18`.

2. Next tactic step:
```lean
theorem mathd_numbertheory_284
  (a b : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9)
  (h₁ : 10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)) :
  10 * a + b = 18 := by
  have h₂ : 8 * a = b := by
    linarith
  sorry

=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_numbertheory_284
  (a b : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9)
  (h₁ : 10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)) :
  10 * a + b = 18 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
a b : ℕ
h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9
h₁ : 10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)
⊢ 10 * a + b = 18
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
