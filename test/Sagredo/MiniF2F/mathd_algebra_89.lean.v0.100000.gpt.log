assistant:
I apologize for the confusion again. It seems that I made another mistake in selecting the appropriate lemma. Since we are dealing with real numbers and integer exponents, we can use `Real.rpow_int_cast` to handle the exponentiation. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import algebra.real_power

theorem mathd_algebra_89
  (b : ℝ)
  (h₀ : b ≠ 0) :
  (7 * b^3)^2 * (4 * b^2)^(-(3 : ℤ)) = 49/64 := by
  rw [Real.rpow_int_cast, Real.pow_mul, Real.pow_mul, Real.mul_inv']
  -- goal state:
  -- b : ℝ
  -- h₀ : b ≠ 0
  -- ⊢ (7 * b ^ 3) ^ 2 * (4 * b ^ 2) ^ 3⁻¹ = 49 / 64
```

user:
When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 5, located on the tokens `Int.pow_neg`:

```
error: unknown constant 'Int.pow_neg'
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that `Real.rpow_neg` is also not a valid lemma in Lean 4. We can instead use `Real.rpow_def_of_neg` to handle the negative exponent. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import algebra.real_power

theorem mathd_algebra_89
  (b : ℝ)
  (h₀ : b ≠ 0) :

1. Plan:
   First, we will simplify the expression on the left-hand side of the equation.
   We will do this by breaking down the expression into smaller parts and simplifying them individually.
   We have the following expression to simplify: $(7 * b^3)^2 * (4 * b^2)^{-3}$.
   We can rewrite this as $(7^2 * b^{3*2}) * (4^{-3} * b^{-3*2})$.
   Now, we can simplify this further to $(49 * b^6) * (\frac{1}{64} * b^{-6})$.
   Finally, we can combine the terms to get $\frac{49}{64}$.

2. Next tactic step:
```lean
theorem mathd_algebra_89
  (b : ℝ)
  (h₀ : b ≠ 0) :
  (7 * b^3)^2 * (4 * b^2)^(-(3 : ℤ)) = 49/64 := by
  rw [Real.pow_neg, Real.pow_mul, Real.pow_mul, Real.mul_inv']
  -- goal state:
  -- b : ℝ
  -- h₀ : b ≠ 0
  -- ⊢ (7 * b ^ 3) ^ 2 * (4 * b ^ 2) ^ 3⁻¹ = 49 / 64
```
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem mathd_algebra_89
  (b : ℝ)
  (h₀ : b ≠ 0) :
  (7 * b^3)^2 * (4 * b^2)^(-(3 : ℤ)) = 49/64 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
b : ℝ
h₀ : b ≠ 0
⊢ (7 * b ^ 3) ^ 2 * (4 * b ^ 2) ^ (-3) = 49 / 64
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
