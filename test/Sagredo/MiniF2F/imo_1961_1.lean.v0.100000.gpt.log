I apologize for the confusion. I made a mistake in my previous response. We should use the `apply And.intro` tactic instead of `split`. Here is the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem imo_1961_p1
  (x y z a b : ℝ)
  (h₀ : 0 < x ∧ 0 < y ∧ 0 < z)
  (h₁ : x ≠ y)
  (h₂ : y ≠ z)
  (h₃ : z ≠ x)
  (h₄ : x + y + z = a)
  (h₅ : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = b^2)
  (h₆ : x * y = z^2) :
  0 < a ∧ b^2 < a^2 ∧ a^2 < 3 * b^2 := by
  have h₀a : 0 < a := by
    have h_pos_sum : 0 < x + y + z := add_pos (add_pos h₀.1 h₀.2.1) h₀.2.2
    rw [h₄] at h_pos_sum
    exact h_pos_sum
  apply And.intro
  exact h₀a
```

Now the goal state is:

```
x y z a b : ℝ
h₀ : 0 < x ∧ 0 < y ∧ 0 < z
h₁ : x ≠ y
h₂ : y ≠ z
h₃ : z ≠ x
h₄ : x + y + z = a
h₅ : x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 + z ^ 2 = b ^ 2
h₆ : x * y = z ^ 2
h₀a : 0 < a
⊢ b ^ 2 < a ^ 2 ∧ a ^ 2 < 3 * b ^ 2
```

1. Plan:
   - We have already shown that `0 < a`.
   - Next, we will show that `b^2 < a^2`. We will use `h₀`, `h₄`, `h₅`, and `h₆` to derive some inequalities and manipulate them to get the desired inequality.
   - Finally, we will show that `a^2 < 3 * b^2`. We will again use `h₀`, `h₄`, `h₅`, and `h₆` to derive some inequalities and manipulate them to get the desired inequality.

2. Next tactic step:
```lean

1. Plan:
   - First, we will show that `0 < a`. We can do this by using `h₀` and `h₄`.
   - Next, we will show that `b^2 < a^2`. We will use `h₀`, `h₄`, `h₅`, and `h₆` to derive some inequalities and manipulate them to get the desired inequality.
   - Finally, we will show that `a^2 < 3 * b^2`. We will again use `h₀`, `h₄`, `h₅`, and `h₆` to derive some inequalities and manipulate them to get the desired inequality.

   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
