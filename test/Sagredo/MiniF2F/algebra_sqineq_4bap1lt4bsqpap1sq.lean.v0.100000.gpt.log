assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. It seems that the `calc` tactic is not suitable for this situation. Instead, let's use the `apply` tactic to apply the result `h` directly to the goal. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring

theorem algebra_sqineq_4bap1lt4bsqpap1sq
  (a b : ℝ) :
  4 * b * (a + 1) ≤ 4 * b^2 + (a + 1)^2 := by
  have h : ((a + 1) - 2 * b)^2 ≥ 0 := sq_nonneg _
  rw [pow_two, sub_eq_add_neg, add_mul, add_mul, neg_mul_eq_neg_mul, neg_mul_eq_neg_mul] at h
  apply le_add_of_nonneg_left h
```

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 5, located on the tokens `calc ((a + 1) - 2 * b)^2 = (a + 1)^2 - 2 * (a + 1) * 2 * b + 4 * b^2`:

```
error: 'calc' tactic failed, has type
  ((a + 1 - 2 * b) ^ 2 = (a + 1) ^ 2 - 2 * (a + 1) * 2 * b + 4 * b ^ 2) =
    ((a + 1 - 2 * b) ^ 2 = (a + 1) ^ 2 - 2 * (a + 1) * 2 * b + 4 * b ^ 2)
but it is expected to have type
  4 * b * (a + 1) ≤ 4 * b ^ 2 + (a + 1) ^ 2
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. It seems that the rewrite tactic failed to find the pattern in the target expression. We can fix this by using the `calc` tactic to manually expand and simplify the expression step by step. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring

theorem algebra_sqineq_4bap1lt4bsqpap1sq
  (a b : ℝ) :
  4 * b * (a + 1) ≤ 4 * b^2 + (a + 1)^2 := by
  have h : ((a + 1) - 2 * b)^2 ≥ 0 := sq_nonneg _
  calc ((a + 1) - 2 * b)^2 = (a + 1)^2 - 2 * (a + 1) * 2 * b + 4 * b^2 : by ring
    ... ≥ 4 * b^2 + (a + 1)^2 : by le_add_of_nonneg_left h
  sorry

I apologize for the mistake. I used an incorrect identifier `sq_sub_mul`. Instead, we should manually expand the square and simplify the expression. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring

  (a b : ℝ) :
  4 * b * (a + 1) ≤ 4 * b^2 + (a + 1)^2 := by

  rw [pow_two, sub_eq_add_neg, add_mul, add_mul, neg_mul_eq_neg_mul, neg_mul_eq_neg_mul] at h

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We have already shown that `((a + 1) - 2 * b)^2 ≥ 0`. Now, we want to rewrite the goal in terms of this expression. We can expand the expression `((a + 1) - 2 * b)^2` and simplify it to obtain the desired inequality.

2. Next tactic step:

```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring

theorem algebra_sqineq_4bap1lt4bsqpap1sq
  (a b : ℝ) :
  4 * b * (a + 1) ≤ 4 * b^2 + (a + 1)^2 := by
  have h : ((a + 1) - 2 * b)^2 ≥ 0 := sq_nonneg _
  rw [sq_sub_mul, mul_two, mul_two] at h
  sorry
```
=====
user:
The goal state for the sorry on line 5 is:
```
a b : ℝ
h : (a + 1 - 2 * b) ^ 2 ≥ 0
⊢ 4 * b * (a + 1) ≤ 4 * b ^ 2 + (a + 1) ^ 2
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We want to show that `4 * b * (a + 1) ≤ 4 * b^2 + (a + 1)^2`. We can rewrite the inequality as `(a + 1)^2 - 4 * b * (a + 1) + 4 * b^2 ≥ 0`. This expression is equivalent to `((a + 1) - 2 * b)^2 ≥ 0`. Since the square of any real number is non-negative, the inequality holds.

2. Next tactic step:

```lean
import algebra.ordered_ring

theorem algebra_sqineq_4bap1lt4bsqpap1sq
  (a b : ℝ) :
  4 * b * (a + 1) ≤ 4 * b^2 + (a + 1)^2 := by
  have h : ((a + 1) - 2 * b)^2 ≥ 0 := sq_nonneg _
  sorry

=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem algebra_sqineq_4bap1lt4bsqpap1sq
  (a b : ℝ) :
  4 * b * (a + 1) ≤ 4 * b^2 + (a + 1)^2 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
a b : ℝ
⊢ 4 * b * (a + 1) ≤ 4 * b ^ 2 + (a + 1) ^ 2
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
