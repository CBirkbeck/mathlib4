Apologies for the error. I misunderstood the goal of the `h_pattern` lemma. We should prove that `u (k + 2) % 10 = (u k + u (k + 1)) % 10` for all `k`. I will fix the error by changing the statement of `h_pattern` and updating the proof accordingly.

1. Plan for proceeding:

We have the goal `¬∑ k in Finset.range n, u k > 10000`. To proceed, we will first compute the first few terms of the sequence `u` and try to find a pattern in the last digits of the terms. This will help us find an upper bound for the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence when `n < 1999`.

Once we find the pattern, we can use it to show that the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence cannot be greater than 10000 when `n < 1999`. This will help us prove the goal.

2. Add the next tactic step to the proof:

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We have the goal `¬1999 ≤ n → ¬∑ k in Finset.range n, u k > 10000`. We can proceed by assuming `¬1999 ≤ n` and showing that `¬∑ k in Finset.range n, u k > 10000`.

Since we are given the recurrence relation `u (n + 2) = (u n + u (n + 1)) % 10` for `n ≥ 2`, we can compute the first few terms of the sequence and try to find a pattern in the last digits of the terms. This will help us find an upper bound for the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence when `n < 1999`.

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We are given a sequence `u` defined by `u 0 = 4`, `u 1 = 7`, and `u (n + 2) = (u n + u (n + 1)) % 10` for `n ≥ 2`. We want to show that for any `n`, if the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence is greater than 10000, then `n` must be at least 1999.

To prove this, we can proceed by contradiction. Suppose there exists an `n` such that the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence is greater than 10000, but `n < 1999`. We will try to derive a contradiction from this assumption.

We can first analyze the sequence `u` and find a pattern in its terms. Since the sequence is defined modulo 10, we can focus on the last digit of each term. We can compute the first few terms of the sequence and try to find a pattern.

Next, we can use this pattern to compute the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence. We can then show that if `n < 1999`, the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence cannot be greater than 10000, which contradicts our assumption.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
