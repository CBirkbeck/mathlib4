assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. I used `mul_add` and `add_mul` too early in the proof. We should first replace `(Nat.succ n + 1)` with `(n + 2)` and then expand the squares. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic

open_locale BigOperators

theorem induction_sum2kp1npqsqm1
  (n : ℕ) :
  ∑ k in (Finset.range n), (2 * k + 3) = (n + 1)^2 - 1 := by
  induction n with
  | zero =>
    rw [Finset.range_zero, Finset.sum_empty, Nat.zero_add]
    rfl
  | succ n ih =>
    rw [Finset.range_succ, Finset.sum_insert Finset.not_mem_range_self]
    rw [ih]
    rw [Nat.succ_eq_add_one, add_assoc]
    rw [Nat.pow_two, Nat.pow_two]
    sorry
```

Now the right-hand side of the equation is simplified, and we can proceed with showing that both sides of the equation are equal.

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 11, located on the tokens `mul_add`:

```

```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. I used `Nat.pow_two` which is not a valid constant in Lean 4. Instead, we can directly compute the squares of the expressions `(n + 1)` and `(Nat.succ n + 1)` as `(n + 1) * (n + 1)` and `(n + 2) * (n + 2)` respectively. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic

open_locale BigOperators

theorem induction_sum2kp1npqsqm1
  (n : ℕ) :
  ∑ k in (Finset.range n), (2 * k + 3) = (n + 1)^2 - 1 := by

    rw [ih]
    rw [Nat.succ_eq_add_one, mul_add, add_mul, mul_add, add_mul, add_mul]
    sorry
```

1. Here's a plan for proceeding with the induction step:

   a. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation by expanding the terms and combining like terms.
   b. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation by replacing `Nat.succ n` with `n + 1`.
   c. Show that both sides of the equation are equal.

2. The next tactic step is to simplify the left-hand side of the equation. Here's the updated proof:

```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic

open_locale BigOperators

theorem induction_sum2kp1npqsqm1
  (n : ℕ) :
  ∑ k in (Finset.range n), (2 * k + 3) = (n + 1)^2 - 1 := by

    rw [ih]
    rw [Nat.succ_eq_add_one, Nat.pow_two, Nat.pow_two]
    sorry
```

Now the right-hand side of the equation is simplified, and we can proceed with showing that both sides of the equation are equal.

1. Here's a plan for proceeding with the induction step:

   a. Apply the induction hypothesis to the sum over the range `n` on the left-hand side of the equation.
   b. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation.
   c. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation.
   d. Show that both sides of the equation are equal.

2. The next tactic step is to apply the induction hypothesis. Here's the updated proof:

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. I used `Finset.not_mem_range_self n` incorrectly. Instead, we can use `Finset.not_mem_range_self` directly without passing `n` as an argument. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic

open_locale BigOperators

theorem induction_sum2kp1npqsqm1

    rfl
  | succ n ih =>
    rw [Finset.range_succ, Finset.sum_insert Finset.not_mem_range_self]

assistant:
1. Here's a plan for proceeding with the induction step:

   a. Use the property of `Finset.range` for `Nat.succ n` to rewrite the sum on the left-hand side of the equation.
   b. Use the property of `Finset.sum` to split the sum into two parts: one for the range `n` and one for the term `2 * (n + 1) + 3`.
   c. Apply the induction hypothesis to the sum over the range `n`.
   d. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation.
   e. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation.
   f. Show that both sides of the equation are equal.

2. The next tactic step is to rewrite the sum on the left-hand side of the equation using the property of `Finset.range`. Here's the updated proof:

```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic

open_locale BigOperators

theorem induction_sum2kp1npqsqm1
  (n : ℕ) :
  ∑ k in (Finset.range n), (2 * k + 3) = (n + 1)^2 - 1 := by

    rfl
  | succ n ih =>
    rw [Finset.range_succ, Finset.sum_insert (Finset.not_mem_range_self n)]

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. I used `Nat.sub_self` which is not applicable in this case. Instead, we can directly compute `1 ^ 2 - 1` as `1 - 1`. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

```lean

theorem induction_sum2kp1npqsqm1
  (n : ℕ) :

I apologize for the mistake. I used `Nat.pow_one` which is not a valid constant in Lean 4. Instead, we can directly compute `(Nat.zero + 1) ^ 2` as `1 ^ 2`. Here's the updated proof with the corrected tactic step:

assistant:
1. Here's a plan for proceeding with the base case:

   a. Observe that `Finset.range Nat.zero` is an empty set.
   b. The sum over an empty set is 0.
   c. Evaluate the right-hand side of the equation for `n = 0`.
   d. Show that both sides of the equation are equal.

assistant:
1. Here's a plan for proceeding:

   a. Perform induction on `n`.
   b. For the base case, when `n = 0`, show that both sides of the equation are equal.
   c. For the induction step, assume the induction hypothesis for `n`, and prove the equation for `n + 1`.
   d. In the induction step, use the properties of `Finset.range`, `Finset.sum`, and arithmetic operations to manipulate the equation and apply the induction hypothesis.

2. The next tactic step is to perform induction on `n`. Here's the updated proof:

```lean
import Mathlib.Algebra.BigOperators.Basic

=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem induction_sum2kp1npqsqm1
  (n : ℕ) :
  ∑ k in (Finset.range n), (2 * k + 3) = (n + 1)^2 - 1 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
n : ℕ
⊢ ∑ k in Finset.range n, (2 * k + 3) = (n + 1) ^ 2 - 1
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
