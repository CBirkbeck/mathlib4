assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that I used an incorrect tactic. I will replace `ringExp` with `ring`. Here's the corrected proof:

```lean
theorem induction_divisibility_3divnto3m2n
  (n : ℕ) :
  3 ∣ n^3 + 2 * n := by
  induction n with
  | zero =>
    have h : (0 : ℕ)^3 + 2 * 0 = 0 := by
      rw [Nat.mul_zero, Nat.add_zero]
    rw [h]
    exact dvd_zero 3
  | succ n ih =>
    have h : (n + 1)^3 + 2 * (n + 1) = n^3 + 3 * n^2 + 3 * n + 1 + 2 * n + 2 := by
      rw [Nat.succ_eq_add_one, Nat.pow_succ, Nat.pow_succ, Nat.pow_zero, Nat.mul_one, Nat.mul_add, Nat.mul_add, Nat.mul_add, Nat.mul_add, Nat.mul_one, Nat.mul_one, Nat.mul_one]
      ring
    rw [h]
    sorry
```

Now we have a simplified expression for the goal, and we need to show that it is divisible by 3.

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 13, located on the tokens `ringExp`:

```
error: unknown tactic
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
You used ringExp, but it looks like you maybe meant ring. Try that instead.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.
=====
assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

For the induction step, we need to show that `3 ∣ (n + 1)^3 + 2 * (n + 1)` given the induction hypothesis `3 ∣ n^3 + 2 * n`. We will first expand the expression `(n + 1)^3 + 2 * (n + 1)` using the binomial theorem and distributive property. Then, we will rearrange the terms to show that the expression is divisible by 3.

2. Next tactic step:

```lean
theorem induction_divisibility_3divnto3m2n
  (n : ℕ) :
  3 ∣ n^3 + 2 * n := by
  induction n with
  | zero =>
    have h : (0 : ℕ)^3 + 2 * 0 = 0 := by
      rw [Nat.mul_zero, Nat.add_zero]
    rw [h]
    exact dvd_zero 3
  | succ n ih =>
    have h : (n + 1)^3 + 2 * (n + 1) = n^3 + 3 * n^2 + 3 * n + 1 + 2 * n + 2 := by
      rw [Nat.succ_eq_add_one, Nat.pow_succ, Nat.pow_succ, Nat.pow_zero, Nat.mul_one, Nat.mul_add, Nat.mul_add, Nat.mul_add, Nat.mul_add, Nat.mul_one, Nat.mul_one, Nat.mul_one]
      ringExp
    rw [h]
    sorry
```

Now we have a simplified expression for the goal, and we need to show that it is divisible by 3.

user:
The goal state for the sorry on line 10 is:
```
case succ
n : ℕ
ih : 3 ∣ n ^ 3 + 2 * n
⊢ 3 ∣ Nat.succ n ^ 3 + 2 * Nat.succ n
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that I made another mistake in the base case. I will now use a different approach to simplify the expression for the base case. Here's the corrected proof:

```lean
theorem induction_divisibility_3divnto3m2n
  (n : ℕ) :
  3 ∣ n^3 + 2 * n := by
  induction n with
  | zero =>
    have h : (0 : ℕ)^3 + 2 * 0 = 0 := by
      rw [Nat.mul_zero, Nat.add_zero]
    rw [h]
    exact dvd_zero 3
  | succ n ih => sorry
```

Now the proof should run without errors, and we still have one subgoal left for the induction step.

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. I forgot to enclose the lemma `h` in square brackets when using the `rw` tactic. Here's the corrected proof:

  3 ∣ n^3 + 2 * n := by
  induction n with

assistant:
I apologize for the oversight. It seems that `Nat.pow_zero` is not directly applicable in this case either. We can instead use the fact that 0 raised to any power greater than 0 is 0. Here's the corrected proof:

  3 ∣ n^3 + 2 * n := by

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that `Nat.pow_zero` is not directly applicable in this case. We can instead use the fact that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Here's the corrected proof:

assistant:
I apologize for the mistake. It seems that `Nat.zero_pow` is not a valid constant in Lean 4. Instead, we can use `Nat.pow_zero` with the `rw` tactic to rewrite the expression. Here's the corrected proof:

```lean
theorem induction_divisibility_3divnto3m2n
  (n : ℕ) :
  3 ∣ n^3 + 2 * n := by
  induction n with

assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

For the base case, we need to show that `3 ∣ 0^3 + 2 * 0`. We can simplify this expression to `3 ∣ 0`, which is true since 3 divides 0.

2. Next tactic step:

```lean
theorem induction_divisibility_3divnto3m2n
  (n : ℕ) :
  3 ∣ n^3 + 2 * n := by
  induction n with
  | zero =>
    rw [Nat.zero_pow, Nat.mul_zero, Nat.add_zero]
    exact dvd_zero 3
  | succ n ih => sorry
```

Now we have one subgoal left for the induction step.

user:

2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.

=====
assistant:
1. Plan for proceeding:

We will use induction on `n`. The base case is when `n = 0`. We will show that `3 ∣ 0^3 + 2 * 0`. For the induction step, we will assume that the property holds for `n`, i.e., `3 ∣ n^3 + 2 * n`, and we will show that it also holds for `n + 1`, i.e., `3 ∣ (n + 1)^3 + 2 * (n + 1)`.

2. Next tactic step:

```lean
theorem induction_divisibility_3divnto3m2n
  (n : ℕ) :
  3 ∣ n^3 + 2 * n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => sorry
  | succ n ih => sorry
```

Now we have two subgoals, one for the base case and one for the induction step.
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem induction_divisibility_3divnto3m2n
  (n : ℕ) :
  3 ∣ n^3 + 2 * n := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
n : ℕ
⊢ 3 ∣ n ^ 3 + 2 * n
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
