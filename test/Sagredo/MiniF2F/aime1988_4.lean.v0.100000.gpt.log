assistant:
I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. It seems that I made a mistake in copying the corrected code. The syntax error is actually in the `{α : Type*}` part of the type declaration. The correct syntax for the type declaration is `{α : Type}` instead of `{α : Type*}`. I will fix this and update the lemma definition.

Here's the updated tactic step:

```lean

lemma Finset.sum_lt_of_lt_one {α : Type} [OrderedCancelAddCommMonoid α] {s : Finset ℕ} {f : ℕ → α} (hf : ∀ x ∈ s, f x < 1) (hs : 0 < Finset.card s) : Finset.sum s f < Finset.card s :=

Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that I made a mistake in my previous response. The syntax error is actually in the `DecidableEq α` part of the type class constraints. We don't need `DecidableEq α` for this lemma, so I will remove it from the type class constraints.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that `Finset.sum_lt_sum_of_subset` is not applicable here. We will manually prove the inequality using the `Finset.sum_lt_of_lt_one` lemma from Lean 3, which is not available in Lean 4. We will define this lemma and then use it in our proof.

1. Plan:
   - We will use the fact that each term has an absolute value less than 1 to show that the sum of the absolute values of the terms is less than n.
   - We will use the fact that the sum of the absolute values of the terms is equal to 19 plus the absolute value of the sum of the terms to show that there must be at least 20 terms in the sum.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
