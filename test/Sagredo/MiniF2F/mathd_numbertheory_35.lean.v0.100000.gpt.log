I apologize for the oversight. I mistakenly left the `{d : ℕ | d ∣ 14}.toFinset` in the lemma. We should use the `divisors_of_14_list.toFinset` instead. Here's the corrected code:

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Finset

def divisors_of_14_list : List ℕ := [1, 2, 7, 14]

Now the error should be resolved.

When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 3, located on the tokens `{d : ℕ | d ∣ 14}.toFinset`:

```
error: failed to synthesize instance

Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

assistant:
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `set_fintype` attribute is not available in the current version of Mathlib. Instead, we can use a different approach to define the divisors of 14 as a `Finset`. We can create a list of divisors and then convert it to a `Finset`.

Here's the corrected code:

```lean

=====
assistant:
I apologize for the error. The issue is that Lean cannot synthesize a `Fintype` instance for the set `{d : ℕ | d ∣ 14}`. To fix this, we can explicitly provide the `Fintype` instance for this set by using the `set_fintype` attribute.

Here's the corrected code:

assistant:
1. Plan:
   - We already have `h₁ : Nat.sqrt 196 = 14`. Now we need to find the divisors of 14.
   - We can create a new lemma `divisors_of_14` to list the divisors of 14.
   - Then, we can use the property `h₀` to show that every element in `S` is a divisor of 14, and every divisor of 14 is in `S`.
   - Finally, we can use the fact that the sum of elements in `S` is equal to the sum of divisors of 14, which is 24.

assistant:
1. Plan:
   - First, we need to find the divisors of `Nat.sqrt 196`, which is 14. The divisors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14.
   - Since the sum of these divisors is 24, we can show that the given sum equals 24 by showing that `S` is equal to the set of divisors of 14.
   - To do this, we can use the property `h₀` and show that every element in `S` is a divisor of 14, and every divisor of 14 is in `S`.
   - Finally, we can use the fact that the sum of elements in `S` is equal to the sum of divisors of 14, which is 24.

=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
