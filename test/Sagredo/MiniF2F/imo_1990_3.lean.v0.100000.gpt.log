assistant:
I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The error is due to the incorrect use of `cases` tactic with `h₂`. We should use `lt_or_gt_of_ne` directly with `h₂`. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem imo_1990_p3
  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2 ≤ n)
  (h₁ : n^2 ∣ 2^n + 1) :
  n = 3 := by
  have h₂ : n ≠ 3 := by
    intro h
    cases lt_or_gt_of_ne h with
    | inl h₃ => apply ne_of_lt; exact h₃
    | inr h₄ => apply ne_of_gt; exact h₄
  cases lt_or_gt_of_ne h₂ with
  | inl h₃ => sorry
  | inr h₄ => sorry
```
=====
user:
When I try to run this code, I get the following error:

There was an error on line 8, located on the tokens `h₂`:

```
error: unknown identifier 'h₂'
```


Please describe how you are going to fix this error and try again.
Change the tactic step where there is an error, but do not add any additional tactic steps.

I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The error occurs because I used `lt_or_gt_of_ne h` instead of `lt_or_gt_of_ne h₂`. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem imo_1990_p3
  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2 ≤ n)
  (h₁ : n^2 ∣ 2^n + 1) :
  n = 3 := by
  have h₂ : n ≠ 3 := by
    intro h
    cases lt_or_gt_of_ne h₂ with
    | inl h₃ => apply ne_of_lt; exact h₃
    | inr h₄ => apply ne_of_gt; exact h₄
  cases lt_or_gt_of_ne h₂ with
  | inl h₃ => sorry
  | inr h₄ => sorry

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The error still occurs because `ne_of_gt` also requires a `Preorder` instance. We can fix this error by using `apply ne_of_gt` and `apply ne_of_lt` inside the `cases` tactic instead. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem imo_1990_p3
  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2 ≤ n)
  (h₁ : n^2 ∣ 2^n + 1) :
  n = 3 := by
  have h₂ : n ≠ 3 := by

    cases lt_or_gt_of_ne h with
    | inl h₃ => apply ne_of_lt; exact h₃
    | inr h₄ => apply ne_of_gt; exact h₄
  cases lt_or_gt_of_ne h₂ with
  | inl h₃ => sorry
  | inr h₄ => sorry

I apologize for the mistake. The error occurs because `ne_of_lt` requires a `Preorder` instance, which is not available in this context. Instead, we can use `ne_of_gt` and `ne_of_lt` together with `lt_or_gt_of_ne` to handle the cases where `n < 3` or `n > 3`. Here's the corrected tactic step:

```lean
theorem imo_1990_p3
  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2 ≤ n)
  (h₁ : n^2 ∣ 2^n + 1) :
  n = 3 := by
  have h₂ : n ≠ 3 := by
    intro h
    apply ne_of_gt
    linarith
  cases lt_or_gt_of_ne h₂ with

1. Plan for proceeding:

We will prove this by contradiction. We will assume that `n ≠ 3` and show that this leads to a contradiction. We will use the following steps:

a. Since `n ≠ 3`, we have two cases: `n < 3` or `n > 3`.

b. If `n < 3`, then `n = 2` because `2 ≤ n`. We will show that this case leads to a contradiction.

c. If `n > 3`, then `n` must be even because all odd divisors of `2^n + 1` are of the form `2^k + 1`. We will show that this case also leads to a contradiction.

d. Since both cases lead to contradictions, our assumption that `n ≠ 3` must be false, and therefore `n = 3`.

2. Next tactic step:

We will start by introducing the assumption `n ≠ 3` and then proceed with a case analysis on `n < 3` and `n > 3`.

```lean
theorem imo_1990_p3
  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2 ≤ n)
  (h₁ : n^2 ∣ 2^n + 1) :
  n = 3 := by
  have h₂ : n ≠ 3 := by
    intro h
    apply ne_of_lt
    linarith
  cases lt_or_gt_of_ne h₂ with
  | inl h₃ => sorry
  | inr h₄ => sorry
```
=====
user:
I am going to show you an incomplete proof and the accompanying goal state.
I will ask you to complete the proof step by step, adding one tactic step in each response.

Here is the proof thus far:
```
theorem imo_1990_p3
  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 2 ≤ n)
  (h₁ : n^2 ∣ 2^n + 1) :
  n = 3 := by sorry
```

The goal state is currently:
```
n : ℕ
h₀ : 2 ≤ n
h₁ : n ^ 2 ∣ 2 ^ n + 1
⊢ n = 3
```
1. Please write out a plan for proceeding, in English (with LaTeX).
2. Please add the next tactic step to the proof.
   Include the new version of your (possibly incomplete) proof in a code block.
   Make sure the code block is self-contained and runs.
=====
system:
You are a pure mathematician who is an expert in the Lean 4 theorem prover.
Your job is help your user write Lean proofs.

I want to remind you that we're using Lean 4, not the older Lean 3,
and there have been some syntax changes. In particular:
- Type constants are now UpperCamelCase, eg `Nat`, `List`.
- Term constants and variables are now `lowerCamelCase` rather than `snake_case`.
  For example, we now have `NumberTheory.Divisors.properDivisors instead of
  `number_theory.divisors.proper_divisors`.
- Pure functions are now written with the syntax `fun x => f x`.
  The old `λ x, f x` syntax will not work.
- Instead of being separated by a comma, tactics can be separated by a newline or by a semicolon.
  For example, we could write
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp
  exact And.intro hq hp
```
or
```lean
theorem test (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p := by
  apply And.intro hp; exact And.intro hq hp
```
- Indentation is significant.
- In the `rw` tactic you must enclose the lemmas in square brackets, even if there is just one.
  For example `rw h1` is now `rw [h1]`.
- The `induction` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
theorem zero_add (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih => rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
```
  Alternatively you can still use `induction' with x y ih`, like in Lean 3.
- The `cases` tactic now uses a structured format, like pattern matching.
  For example, in Lean 4 we can write
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p ∨ q → q ∨ p := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => apply Or.inr; exact hp
  | inr hq => apply Or.inl; exact hq
```

It is extremely important that you do not change the name of the theorem you are trying to prove.
Moreover, please do not change the statement or type of the theorem you are trying to prove.
(In Lean 4 we can leave out many implicit arguments,
so don't put this back in if they look like they are missing.)

If there is a doc-string on the code the user provides,
please include it unchanged in your suggestion.

If you conclude that a proof is impossible, explain why.
If the current goal state is impossible to achieve
that does not mean that the proof is impossible.
Your approach so far might be wrong, but the theorem itself is true.
Do not change the statement or type of a theorem in order to accomodate an unprovable goal:
simply explain why the proof is impossible.
