# `./fro-okrs.sh` returns a tally of some technical debts in current Mathlib,
# reporting also the change with respect to the same counts in Mathlib from last week.
# This is intended for measuring progress with respect to the Lean FRO's OKRs.

# the script takes two optional arguments `<optCurrCommit> <optReferenceCommit>`
# and tallies the same technical debts on `<optCurrCommit>` using `<optReferenceCommit>`
# as a reference.
# If `$1` is supplied and is not `pr_summary`, then we use it; otherwise, we fall back to
# `$(git rev-parse HEAD)`.
# Similarly for the second argument: if `$1` (note the 1, not 2!) is `pr_summary`, then we use
# the closest version of master that we can find to the current commit. Otherwise we use the second
# input, falling back to a commit from last week if `$2` is not provided.
