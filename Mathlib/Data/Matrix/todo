TODO:
- change variable names inside of bodies when using ext
- will generalize identity matrices of mulRow and addMulRow
- will have to troubleshoot issues with continuous integration
- ask if i should leave sections as is or do namespaces
- parse through all swapRow theorems and do what i did for the others
- simplify bodies of theorems 
- check for delimiters and normal form
- might need to switch theorem names to pure snake_case (ask on Zulip)
- final check if theorems have correct spacing


FUTURE TODO:
prove that elementary matrices are invertible?
