TODO:
- will have to troubleshoot issues with continuous integration
- ask if i should leave sections as is or do namespaces, on that note: should we leave   mulRow_id_mul_mat_eq_mulRow_mat as is
- parse through all swapRow theorems and do what i did for the others
- add docstring on theorems and lemmas
- the ones like mulRow_inv need to be checked and if we even want to write stuff like that
- make left and right of mulRow_mulRow_inv_cancel 
- simplify bodies of theorems 
- check for delimiters and normal form
- might need to switch theorem names to pure snake_case (ask on Zulip)
- final check if theorems have correct spacing


FUTURE TODO:
prove that elementary matrices are invertible?
