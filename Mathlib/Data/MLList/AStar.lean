# A^* search

This implementation is only intended for use in meta code, rather than algorithmic analysis.
Someone might enjoy writing a "mathematical" version.

/--
Data structure encoding a graph for A^* search.

This records the source and target of each directed edge,
the edges leaving each vertex (as a lazy list),
the weight of each edge,
and the heuristic distance to a goal for each vertex.

Data associated to a vertex during A^* search.

Mutable state during A^* search.

We maintain a priority queue as a red-black tree backed multimap from priorities to vertices.
We additionally maintain vertex data
(consisting of priority, best yet path, and explored/remaining edges)
for each vertex visited so far.

Record a new path.
* If the ending vertex has not been seen before, build new `VertexData`,
  and add the vertex to the queue.
* If the ending vertex has been seen before, and this path is no better than the previous best path,
  do nothing.
* If this is better than the previous best path:
  * Move the ending vertex up in the priority queue
  * Record it as the new best path
  * And, if we are searching for optimal solutions (i.e. paths with shortest length),
    recursively record all paths obtained by adding a previously explored edge to this path.

/--
Perform A^* search on a graph, starting from a given vertex.

The graph should be encoded using `AStar.GraphData`.

If the option `optimal` is false,
then we don't update best paths when a shorter path is found to an already visited vertex.
If the heuristic is "consistent", this will never happen.
However if the heuristic is "admissible" but not "consistent",
`optimal` must be true if you want the shortest path.
(In practice, the heuristic is often neither consistent nor admissible,
and you will need to test whether `optimal` is suitable for your requirements.)

Returns a monadic lazy list consisting of triples `(priority, vertex, path)`
for each vertex we explore an edge from. `path` is the best path so far to that vertex.

See also `aStarSearch` which just provides the solution,
rather than all the partial solutions explored along the way.

/--
Perform A^* search on a graph,
starting at a vertex `src` and ending when reaching a vertex satisfying `goal`.

Note that the `goal` is probably also implicitly described in the `Γ : GraphData m P V E`
argument, as it must produce the heuristic estimates of distance to goal.

If the option `optimal` is false,
then we don't update best paths when a shorter path is found to an already visited vertex.
(See the doc-string for `aStarSearchPaths` for details.)

Returns a list of edges, wrapped in the same monad the graph edges are generated in.

See also `aStarSearchPaths` which iterates through
all paths explored on the way to finding the solution.
