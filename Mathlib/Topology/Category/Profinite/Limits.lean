# Explicit limits and colimits

This file collects some constructions of explicit limits and colimits in `Profinite`,
which may be useful due to their definitional properties.

## Main definitions

- `Profinite.pullback`: Explicit pullback, defined in the "usual" way as a subset of the product.
- `Profinite.finiteCoproduct`: Explicit finite coproducts, defined as a disjoint union.
