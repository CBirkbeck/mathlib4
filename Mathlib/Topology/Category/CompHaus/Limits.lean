# Explicit limits and colimits

This file collects some constructions of explicit limits and colimits in `CompHaus`,
which may be useful due to their definitional properties.

So far, we have the following:
- Explicit pullbacks, defined in the "usual" way as a subset of the product.
- Explicit finite coproducts, defined as a disjoint union.

Previously, this had accidentally been made a global instance,
and we now turn it on locally when convenient.
