# Compactly coherent spaces and the k-ification

In this file we will define compactly coherent spaces and the compact coherentification and prove
basic properties about them. This is a weaker version of `CompactlyGeneratedSpace`.
These notions agree on Hausdorff spaces. They are both referred to as compactly generated spaces in
the literature while the compact coherentification is often called the k-ification.

## Main definitions
* `CompactlyCoherentSpace`: A compactly coherent space is a topological space in which a set `A` is
  open iff for every compact set `B`, the intersection `A ∩ B` is open in `B`.
* `CompactlyCoherentSpace.CompactCoherentification`: For a topological space `X` one can define
  another topology on `X` as follows: `A` is open iff for all compact sets `B`, the intersection
  `A ∩ B` is open in `B`.

## Main results
* `CompactlyCoherentSpace.of_weaklyLocallyCompactSpace`: every weakly locally compact space is a
  compactly coherent space.
* `CompactlyCoherentSpace.of_sequentialSpace`: every sequential space is a compactly coherent space.
* `CompactlyCoherentSpace.isCompact_iff_isCompact_in_compactCoherentification`: The compact sets of
  a topological space and its compact coherentification agree.
* `CompactlyCoherentSpace.CompactCoherentification.instCompactlyCoherentSpace`: The compact
  coherentification makes any space into a compactly coherent space.
* `CompactlyCoherentSpace.compactCoherentification_compactlyCoherentSpace_eq_self`: The compact
  coherentification of a compactly coherent space `X` preserves the topology on `X`.
* `CompactlyCoherentSpace.continuous_compactCoherentification_of_continuousOn_compact`: If a map
  `f : X → Y` is continuous on every compact subset of `X` then it is continuous when viewed as a
  map from `CompactCoherentification X` to `CompactCoherentification Y`.
