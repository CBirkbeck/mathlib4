# Sums of squares

We introduce sums of squares in a type `R` endowed with an `[Add R]`, `[Zero R]` and `[Mul R]`
instances. Sums of squares in `R` are defined by an inductive predicate `IsSumSq : R → Prop`:
`0 : R` is a sum of squares and if `S` is a sum of squares, then for all `a : R`, `a * a + S` is a
sum of squares in `R`.

## Declarations

- The predicate `IsSumSq : R → Prop`, defining the property of being a sum of squares in `R`.
- The terms `AddMonoid.sumSqIn R` and `Subsemiring.sumSqIn R` :
in an additive monoid with multiplication `R` and a semiring `R`, we introduce the terms
`AddMonoid.sumSqIn R` and `Subsemiring.sumSqIn R` as the submonoid and subsemiring, respectively,
of sums of squares in `R`.

In a type `R` with an addition, a zero element and a multiplication, the property of being a sum of
squares is defined by an inductive predicate: `0 : R` is a sum of squares and if `S` is a sum of
squares, then for all `a : R`, `a * a + S` is a sum of squares in `R`.
