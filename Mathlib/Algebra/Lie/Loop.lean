# Loop Lie algebras and their central extensions

Given a Lie algebra `L`, the loop algebra is the Lie algebra of maps from a circle into `L`. This
can mean many different things, e.g., continuous maps, smooth maps, polynomial maps. In this file,
we consider the simplest case of polynomial maps, meaning we take a base change with the ring of
Laurent polynomials.

Representations of loop algebras are not particularly interesting - a theorem of Rao (1993) shows
that when `L` is complex semisimple, any irreducible representation is just given by evaluation of
loops at specific points.  However, the theory becomes much richer when one considers projective
representations, i.e., representations of a central extension.

## Main definitions (Todo for now)
