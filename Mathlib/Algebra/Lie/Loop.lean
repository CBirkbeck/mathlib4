# Loop Lie algebras and their central extensions

Given a Lie algebra `L`, the loop algebra is the Lie algebra of maps from a circle into `L`. This
can mean many different things, e.g., continuous maps, smooth maps, polynomial maps. In this file,
we consider the simplest case of polynomial maps, meaning we take a base change with the ring of
Laurent polynomials.

Representations of loop algebras are not particularly interesting - a theorem of Rao (1993) asserts
that when `L` is complex semisimple, any irreducible representation of `L[z,z^{-1}]` is just given
by evaluation of loops at a finite set of specific points. However, the theory becomes much richer
when one considers projective representations, i.e., representations of a central extension. Common
examples include generalized Verma modules, given by pulling a representation of `L` back to a
representation of `L[z] ⊕ C` along the homomorphism `z ↦ 0` together with a central character, and
inducing to the central extension of the loop algebra.

section CentralExt

-- show that an invariant bilinear form on `L` produces a 2-cocycle for `LoopAlgebra R L`.
-- define central extensions given by invariant bilinear forms
-- extend central characters to reps of positive part
-- induce positive part reps to centrally extended loop algebra
-- monomial basis of induced rep (needs PBW)
-- define positive energy reps (positive part `U+` acts locally nilpotently - `U+ • v` fin dim.)
