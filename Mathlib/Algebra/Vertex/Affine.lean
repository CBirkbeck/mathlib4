# Vertex algebras attached to affine Lie algebras
Given a Lie algebra `L` over a commutative ring `R`, a central extension `C → g → L[z,z⁻¹]`, and a
positive-energy representation `V` of `g` with fixed central character `χ: C → R` we define vertex
operators on `V` attached to elements of `g`.  We show that they are local, so `V` is a module for
the vertex algebra they generate.
## Definitions
* `vertexOperator x V` : the vertex operator for `x` on `V`.
* `vertexAlgebra χ g` : the vertex algebra generated by fields.
## Main results
* The fields generated isomorphic vertex algebras.
## To do:
Write defs and proofs.
