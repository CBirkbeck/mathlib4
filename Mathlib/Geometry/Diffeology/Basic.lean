# Diffeological spaces

A diffeological space is a concrete sheaf on the site of cartesian spaces ℝⁿ and smooth maps
between them, or equivalently a set `X` with a well-behaved notion of smoothness for functions from
ℝⁿ to X - see https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/diffeological+space.

In this file we define some of the basic notions of diffeology, in particular a typeclass
`DiffeologicalSpace X`, the notions `IsPlot p` and `DSmooth f` for maps ℝⁿ → X resp. X → Y, and the
D-topology, the finest topology on a diffeological space for which all plots are continuous.

## Implementation notes

Instead of defining diffeologies as collections of plots whose domains are the spaces ℝⁿ, we could
have also equivalently allowed the domains to be open subsets of ℝⁿ, or arbitrary smooth manifolds.
We chose to go with the first option because the latter two can both be somewhat inconvenient to
work with in Lean.

A downside of working only with the spaces ℝⁿ instead of also their subsets is that it makes the
sheaf condition / locality condition of diffeologies somewhat awkward to state and prove; to
mitigate this, we provide `DiffeologicalSpace.mkOfPlotsOn` as a way to construct a diffeology from
plots whose domains are subsets of ℝⁿ.

### D-Topology

Since the D-topology does not always commute with e.g. products, it can not be registered as an
instance - otherwise, there would be two `TopologicalSpace`-instances on binary products, the
product topology of the D-topologies on the factors and the D-topology of the product diffeology.
We thus instead define a typeclass `DTopCompatible X` to express when the topology on `X` does match
the D-topology, and also give the D-topology the short name `DTop` to enable use of notations such
as `Continuous[_, DTop]` for continuity with respect to the D-topology.

In order to make it easier to work with diffeological spaces whose natural diffeology does match
the D-topology, we also include the D-topology as part of the data of `DiffeologicalSpace X`.
This allows the diffeologies on e.g. ℝⁿ, manifolds and quotients of diffeological spaces to be
defined in such a way that the D-topology is defeq to the topology that the space already carries.

### Diffeologies on normed spaces
Every normed spaces carries a natural diffeology consisting of all smooth maps from ℝⁿ. While this
"normed space diffeology" does commute with arbitrary products, we can't register it as an instance
because it wouldn't be defeq to the product diffeology on products of normed spaces. We thus only
give it as a definition (`euclideanDiffeology`) instead of an instance, and instead provide a
typeclass `ContDiffCompatible X` for talking about normed spaces equipped with the normed space
diffeology.

To make working with finite-dimensional spaces easier, `euclideanDiffeology` is defined in such a
way that its D-topology is defeq to the topology induced by the norm - however, this currently comes
at the cost of making the definition work only on finite-dimensional spaces. It should be possible
to extend this to all Banach or Fréchet spaces though in the future.
