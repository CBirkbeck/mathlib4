# Local diffeomorphisms between smooth manifolds

In this file, we define `C^n` local diffeomorphisms between manifolds.

A `C^n` map `f : M ‚Üí N` is a **local diffeomorphism at `x`** iff there are neighbourhoods `s`
and `t` of `x` and `f x`, respectively such that `f` restricts to a diffeomorphism from `s` and `t`.
`f` is called a **local diffeomorphism** iff it is a local diffeomorphism at every `x ‚àà M`.

## Main definitions
* `LocalDiffeomorphAt I J M N n f x`: `f` is a `C^n` local diffeomorphism at `x`
* `LocalDiffeomorph I J M N n f`: `f` is a `C^n` local diffeomorphism

## Main results
* Each of `Diffeomorph`, `LocalDiffeomorph`, and `LocalDiffeomorphAt` implies the next condition.
* `Diffeomorph.of_bijective_local_diffeomorph`: a bijective local diffeomorphisms is a diffeomorphism.
TODO: a local diffeomorphism is a diffeomorphism to its image

* `LocalDiffeomorphAt.mfderiv_toContinuousLinearEquiv`: if `f` is a local diffeomorphism
at `x`, the differential `mfderiv I J n f x` is a continuous linear isomorphism.
* `LocalDiffeomorphAt.of_DifferentialIsoAt`: conversely, if `f` is `C^n` at `x` and
`mfderiv I J n f x` is a linear isomorphism, `f` is a local diffeomorphism at `x`.

* `LocalDiffeomorph.differential_toContinuousLinearEquiv`: if `f` is a local diffeomorphism,
each differential `mfderiv I J n f x` is a continuous linear isomorphism.
* `LocalDiffeomorph.of_differentialInvertible`: Conversely, if `f` is `C^n` and each differential
is a linear isomorphism, `f` is a local diffeomorphism.

## Design decisions
xxx: fix this up: we don't do this, but instead model after IsLocalStructomorphAt

For all definitions, we use the junk value pattern: a local diffeomorphism at `x` is still given
by a function on all of `M`; its values outside its `source` are irrelevant. (This matches the
treatment of smooth manifolds and `LocalHomeomorph`.)

This combines with the second major design decision: all our definitions are bundled. That is,
we consider `f` together with a choice `g` of inverse. For local diffeomorphisms, `g` can take any
values outside of `f.target`.
A local diffeomorphism contains the data `f` and `g`, together with proofs that these define a
local diffeomorphism at each point.
