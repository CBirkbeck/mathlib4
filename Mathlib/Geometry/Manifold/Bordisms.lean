## (Unoriented) bordism theory

This file defines the beginnings of (unoriented) bordism theory. For the full definition of
smooth oriented bordism groups, a number of prerequisites are missing from mathlib. However,
a significant amount of this work is already possible.

Currently, this file only contains the definition of *singular *n*-manifolds*:
bordism classes are the equivalence classes of singular n-manifolds w.r.t. the (co)bordism relation
and will be added in a future PR, as well as the definition of the (unoriented) bordism groups.

## Main definitions

- **SingularNManifold**: a singular `n`-manifold on a topological space `X`, for `n ∈ ℕ`, is a pair
  `(M, f)` of a closed `n`-dimensional smooth manifold `M` together with a continuous map `M → X`.
  We don't assume `M` to be modelled on `ℝ^n`, but add the model topological space `H`,
  the vector space `E` and the model with corners `I` as type parameters.
- `SingularNManifold.map`: a map `X → Y` of topological spaces induces a map between the spaces
  of singular n-manifolds
- `SingularNManifold.comap`: if `(N,f)` is a singular n-manifold on `X`
  and `φ: M → N` is continuous, the `comap` of `(N,f)` and `φ`
  is the induced singular n-manifold `(M, f ∘ φ)` on `X`.
- `SingularNManifold.empty`: the empty set `M`, viewed as an `n`-manifold,
  as a singular `n`-manifold over any space `X`.
- `SingularNManifold.toPUnit`: an `n`-dimensional manifold induces a singular `n`-manifold
  on the one-point space.
- `SingularNManifold.prod`: the product of a singular `n`-manifold and a singular `m`-manifold
  on the one-point space, is a singular `n+m`-manifold on the one-point space.
- `SingularNManifold.sum`: the disjoint union of two singular `n`-manifolds
  is a singular `n`-manifold.

## Implementation notes

To be written! Document the design decisions and why they were made.

## TODO
- define cobordisms and the cobordism relation
- prove that the cobordisms relation is an equivalence relation
- define unoriented bordisms groups (as a set of equivalence classes),
prove they are a group
- define relative bordism groups (generalising the previous three points)
- prove that relative unoriented bordism groups define an extraordinary homology theory

/-- A **singular `n`-manifold** on a topological space `X`, for `n ∈ ℕ`, is a pair `(M, f)`
of a closed `n`-dimensional `C^k` manifold `M` together with a continuous map `M → X`.
We assume that `M` is a manifold over the pair `(E, H)` with model `I`.

In practice, one commonly wants to take `k=∞` (as then e.g. the intersection form is a powerful tool
to compute bordism groups; for the definition, this makes no difference.) -/
