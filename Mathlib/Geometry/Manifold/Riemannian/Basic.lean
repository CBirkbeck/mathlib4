/-! # Riemannian manifolds

A Riemannian manifold `M` is a real manifold such that its tangent spaces are endowed with a
scalar product, depending smoothly on the point, and such that `M` has an emetric space
structure for which the distance is the infimum of lengths of paths. -/

variable (I M) in
/-- Consider a manifold in which the tangent spaces are already endowed with a scalar product, and
already endowed with an extended distance. We say that this is a Riemannian manifold if the distance
is given by the infimum of the lengths of `C^1` paths, measured using the norm in the tangent
spaces.

This is a `Prop` valued typeclass, on top of existing data. -/
