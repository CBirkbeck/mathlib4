# Smooth manifolds with nice boundary

Many manifolds "in nature" have nice boundary, which is again a smooth manifold one dimension lower.
The definition `SmoothManifoldWithCorners` does not enforce this, to also include manifolds
with corners. In this file, we define a typeclass `HasNiceBoundary`, for smooth manifolds whose
boundary is again a smooth manifold such that the inclusion $‚àÇM ‚Üí M` is smooth.
We do *not* demand that `‚àÇM` have dimension one lower than `M`,
nor that `M` be finite-dimensional, for that matter.

We mostly *do not prove* such instances (as this is more work and out of scope).
**TODO** this file has mostly definitions and sorried theorems; it remains to work out the
details and prove this definition is usable.

This file might get merged into `Manifolds/InteriorBoundary` then.

## TODO
* relax the notation of smoothness, and allow any C^n here
* we assume M, M' and M'' are manifolds over the same space `H` with the same model `I`.
Is this truly necessary, or can we allow something weaker? Would e.g. equivalent models suffice?

/-- All data defining a smooth manifold structure on the boundary of a smooth manifold:
a charted space structure on the boundary, a model with corners and a smooth manifold structure.
This need not exist (say, if `M` has corners); if `M` has no boundary or boundary and no corners,
such a structure is in fact canonically induced.
(Proving this requires more advanced results than we currently have.)
