# Acyclic graphs and trees

This module introduces *acyclic graphs* (a.k.a. *forests*) and *trees*.

## Main definitions

* `SimpleGraph.IsAcyclic` is a predicate for a graph having no cyclic walks
* `SimpleGraph.IsTree` is a predicate for a graph being a tree (a connected acyclic graph)

## Main statements

* `SimpleGraph.isAcyclic_iff_path_unique` characterizes acyclicity in terms of uniqueness of
  paths between pairs of vertices.
* `SimpleGraph.isAcyclic_iff_forall_edge_isBridge` characterizes acyclicity in terms of every
  edge being a bridge edge.
* `SimpleGraph.isTree_iff_existsUnique_path` characterizes trees in terms of existence and
  uniqueness of paths between pairs of vertices from a nonempty vertex type.

## References

The structure of the proofs for `SimpleGraph.IsAcyclic` and `SimpleGraph.IsTree`, including
supporting lemmas about `SimpleGraph.IsBridge`, generally follows the high-level description
for these theorems for multigraphs from [Chou1994].
