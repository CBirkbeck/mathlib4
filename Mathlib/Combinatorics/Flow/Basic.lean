# Network Flows

In this file we introduce network flows. A flow network is as a directed graph where each arc of the
graph has a fixed capacity. A flow from a source vertex `s` to a sink vertex `t` is an assignment of
"flow units" to each edge, such that for all vertices other than the source and the sink, the
incoming flow must equal the outgoing flow (_flow conservation_). The value of such an assignment is
the amount of flow units leaving the source `s` and arriving at the sink `t`. In practice, we are
usually interested in finding a flow of maximal value for a given network.

## Main definitions

- `Network`: A flow network assigning capacities to all pairs of vertices. Notably, capacities and
             non-negative and the capacity from a vertex to itself is zero.
- `PseudoFlow`, `PreFlow`, and `Flow`: An assignment of flow values for a given `Network`, abiding
                                       increasingly strict constraints.

## Notation

For flows `f f' : N.PseudoFlow`, we define `f ≤ f'` as the _subflow relation_, indicating that for
all `u v : V`, `f u v ≤ f' u v`.

## References

See [goldberg_network_1989] for a thorough introduction to the topic.

/-- A `PseudoFlow` is an assignment of non-negative flow values to each arc of the network, such
that the assigned amount does not exceed the capacity.

Note that this definition, in contrast to what can sometimes be found in the literature, does
not require that $f(u, v) = -f(v, u)$. This extra requirement eliminates cycles between two
vertices and makes some theorem statements shorter. However, since larger cycles are still
permitted, this usually does not help in proofs. To the contrary, defining a flow becomes more
cumbersome, sometimes significantly so. -/
