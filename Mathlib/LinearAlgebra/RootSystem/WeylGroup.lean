# The Weyl Group of a root system

This file defines the Weyl group of a root system and some basic properties.

## Main definitions

* `WeylGroup`: Given a root pairing, the Weyl group is the group of automorphisms of the root
lattice generated by the fundamental reflections.

## Results

* faithful action on roots
* Finite... If root system is finite, then so is the Weyl group.
* Angle restrictions on root pairs, `n_αβ` giving length of root string.

## Todo

Everything
