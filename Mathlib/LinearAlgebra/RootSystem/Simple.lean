# Bases of a root system

This file defines systems of simple roots in a root system.

## Main definitions

* `Thin` : A root system is thin if it admits a functional such that there are only finitely many
roots in the preimage of any interval.  This lets us do inductive constructions of the Cartan
matrix given a basis.
* `RegularElement` : Given a thin root system, a regular element is a linear functional on the
root space that takes no roots to zero.  This corresponds to an element of a Lie algebra with
minimal centralizer.
* `Base`: Given a root pairing and separation, a base is basis a minimal subset that generates the
positive half.


## Results

None yet

## Todo

Make a weaker notion than base, to allow infinite root systems with no base.  Take irreducible
elements and find a characterization?

Prove regular elements yield bases in the positive definite case.

Cartan Matrices.

lemma if `x` is regular, and ι is finite then the indecomposable elements for `x` are a base.
(tricky to generalize, since the proof uses positive-definiteness - maybe semidefinite is okay, so
we can do affine roots.  False in general.)

Make a Cartan matrix.

Show that the Cartan matrix is unique?
Show that there is one Weyl orbit of bases, up to sign?
