Hodge star operator or Hodge star is a linear map defined on the exterior algebra of a
finite-dimensional oriented vector space endowed with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form.

α = ⋀ α_i , β = ⋀ β_i ∈ ⋀ᵏ V
⟨α , β⟩ = det( ⟨α_i , β_j⟩ )

{e_i} orthonormal basis for V
ω = ⋀ e_i
α ∧ ⋆β = ⟨α , β⟩ ω
