# Amenable Monoid Actions

In this file, we define amenability of a monoid action.
A monoid action is amenable if it admits an invariant mean.
A mean is like a probability measure, demanding
only finite additivity instead of σ-additivity.

## Main Definitions

- `Mean`: defines means as finitely additive probability measures
- `InvariantMean`: defines when a mean is invariant under a monoid action
- `amenable`: A monoid action is amenable if there exists an invariant mean

## Implementation Notes

`Mean` was not implemented using MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure
because measures are σ-additive (i.e. countably additive). In this
setting, this would be a too strong assumption, we only want to demand
finite additivity. Typically, the resulting measures will not be
σ-additive.
