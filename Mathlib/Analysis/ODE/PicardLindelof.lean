# Picard-Lindelöf (Cauchy-Lipschitz) Theorem

We prove the (local) existence of integral curves and flows to time-dependent vector fields.

Let `f : ℝ → E → E` be a time-dependent (local) vector field on a Banach space, and let `t₀ : ℝ`
and `x₀ : E`. If `f` is Lipschitz continuous in `x` within a closed ball around `x₀` of radius
`a ≥ 0` at every `t` and continuous in `t` at every `x`, then there exists a (local) solution
`α : ℝ → E` to the initial value problem `α t₀ = x₀` and `deriv α t = f t (α t)` for all
`t ∈ Icc tmin tmax`, where `L * max (tmax - t₀) (t₀ - tmin) ≤ a`.

We actually prove a more general version of this theorem for the existence of local flows. If there
is some `r ≥ 0` such that `L * max (tmax - t₀) (t₀ - tmin) ≤ a - r`, then for every
`x ∈ closedBall x₀ r`, there exists a (local) solution `α x` with the initial condition `α t₀ = x`.
In other words, there exists a local flow `α : E → ℝ → E` defined on `closedBall x₀ r` and
`Icc tmin tmax`.

The proof relies on demonstrating the existence of a solution `α` to the following integral
equation:
$$\alpha(t) = x_0 + \int_{t_0}^t f(\tau, \alpha(\tau))\,\mathrm{d}\tau.$$
This is done via the contraction mapping theorem, applied to the space of Lipschitz continuous
functions from a closed interval to a Banach space. The needed contraction map is constructed by
repeated applications of the right hand side of this equation.

## Main definitions and results

* `integrate f t₀ x₀ α t`: the right hand side of the integral equation, applied to the curve `α`.
* `IsPicardLindelof`: the structure holding the assumptions of the Picard-Lindelöf theorem.
* `IsPicardLindelof.exists_eq_hasDerivWithinAt`: the existence theorem for local solutions to
  time-dependent ODEs.
* `IsPicardLindelof.exists_forall_mem_closedBall_eq_hasDerivWithinAt_Icc`: the existence theorem for
  local flows to time-dependent vector fields.

## Implementation notes

* The structure `FunSpace` and theorems within this namespace are implementation details of the
  proof of the Picard-Lindelöf theorem and are not intended to be used outside of this file.
* Some sources, such as Lang, define `FunSpace` as the space of continuous functions from a closed
  interval to a closed ball. We instead define `FunSpace` here as the space of Lipschitz continuous
  functions from a closed interval. This slightly stronger condition allows us to postpone the usage
  of the completeness condition on the space `E` until the application of the contraction mapping
  theorem.
* We have chosen to formalise many of the real constants as `ℝ≥0`, so that the non-negativity of
  certain quantities constructed from them can be shown more easily. When subtraction is involved,
  especially note whether it is the usual subtraction between two reals or the truncated subtraction
  between two non-negative reals.
* We only prove the existence of a solution in this file. For uniqueness, see `ODE_solution_unique`
  and related theorems in `Mathlib/Analysis/ODE/Gronwall.lean`.

/-! ## Integral equation

For any time-dependent vector field `f : ℝ → E → E`, we define an integral equation that is
equivalent to the initial value problem defined by `f`.

`IsPicardLindelof f t₀ x₀ a r L K` means that the time-dependent vector field `f` satisfies the
conditions to admit an integral curve `α : ℝ → E` to `f` defined on `Icc tmin tmax` with the
initial condition `α t₀ = x`, where `‖x - x₀‖ ≤ r`. Note that the initial point `x` is allowed
to differ from the point `x₀` about which the conditions on `f` are stated. -/

/-! ## Space of Lipschitz functions on a closed interval

We define the space of Lipschitz continuous functions from a closed interval. This will be shown to
be a complete metric space on which `integrate` is a contracting map, leading to a fixed point that
will serve as the solution to the ODE. The domain is a closed interval in order to easily inherit
the sup metric from continuous maps on compact spaces. We cannot use functions `ℝ → E` with junk
values outside the domain, as the supremum within a closed interval will only be a pseudo-metric,
and the contracting map will fail to have a fixed point.
