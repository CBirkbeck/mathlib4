# Krull dimension of a preordered set

If `α` is a preordered set, then `krullDim α` is defined to be `sup {n | a₀ < a₁ < ... < aₙ}`.
In case that `α` is empty, then its Krull dimension is defined to be negative infinity; if the
length of all series `a₀ < a₁ < ... < aₙ` is unbounded, then its Krull dimension is defined to
be positive infinity.

For `a : α`, its height is defined to be the krull dimension of the subset `(-∞, a]` while its
coheight is defined to be the krull dimension of `[a, +∞)`.

## Implementation notes
Krull dimensions are defined to take value in `WithBot (WithTop ℕ)` so that `(-∞) + (+∞)` is
also negative infinity. This is because we want Krull dimensions to be additive with respect
to product of varieties so that `-∞` being the Krull dimension of empty variety is equal to
sum of `-∞` and the Krull dimension of any other varieties.

Krull dimension of a preorder `α` is the supremum of the rightmost index of all relation
series of `α` order by `<`. If there is no series `a₀ < a₁ < ... < aₙ` in `α`, then its Krull
dimension is defined to be negative infinity; if the length of all series `a₀ < a₁ < ... < aₙ` is
unbounded, its Krull dimension is defined to be positive infinity.
